# AGENTS.md - v1.4.0 (2026-04-25)
Documentation framework for AI coding agent workflows. Markdown docs + Bash validation scripts + TypeScript CLI/dashboard.

This repo is the goat-flow controlling workspace. When the dashboard or CLI operates on a selected target project, commands like `audit` and `quality` run against that target - not this repo. Keep the two contexts separate: framework code lives here, project-specific harness content lives in the target.
## Essential Commands
```bash
bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh
bash scripts/bump-version.sh <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z>  # Bump package/docs/templates/mirrors
bash .codex/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test  # Codex: verify deny patterns registered (registered hook, not distributable copy)
node --import tsx src/cli/cli.ts stats . --check  # Learning-loop health: last_reviewed + stale refs
npm run typecheck                           # Type-check .ts (required by DoD)
bash -n scripts/*.sh scripts/maintenance/*.sh
shellcheck scripts/*.sh scripts/maintenance/*.sh
npm test                                    # Run fast test suite (excludes slow integration/dashboard)
npm run test:full                          # Run fast + slow suites before release-sensitive changes
```
## Truth Order

1. User's explicit instruction (this session)
2. Instruction file (AGENTS.md)
3. Architecture (.goat-flow/architecture.md)
4. Skills / templates (on-demand context)

## Execution Loop: READ → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY

**READ** - MUST read relevant files before changes. Never fabricate codebase facts. For URL, local HTML, localhost, screenshot, rendered UI, or browser-visible behaviour, check browser evidence first: `command -v browser-use && browser-use doctor`; if available use `browser-use open/state/screenshot`, otherwise ask before installing or use manual fallback. Cross-doc: MUST read all files describing the same concept. Use grep-first retrieval across `.goat-flow/footguns/`, `.goat-flow/lessons/`, and `.goat-flow/patterns/`; include `.goat-flow/decisions/` when the task involves architecture, policy, or setup work. Open matching entries only, reword once on zero hits, then record a retrieval miss instead of broad-loading a bucket.
```
BAD:  "The CLI has 20 audit checks" (guessed without reading)
GOOD: Read src/cli/audit/check-goat-flow.ts → 13 setup checks, check-agent-setup.ts → 4 agent checks (17 total)
```

**SCOPE** - Three signals before acting: (1) Intent: question → answer it, directive → act on it. (2) Complexity + budgets (below). (3) Mode: Plan / Implement / Explain / Debug / Review. MUST declare before acting: files allowed to change, non-goals, max blast radius. Expanding beyond scope = stop and re-scope with human.

| Complexity | Typical read budget | Typical turn budget |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Hotfix | 2 reads | 3 turns |
| Standard Feature | 4 reads | 10 turns |
| System Change | 6 reads | 20 turns |
| Infrastructure | 8 reads | 25 turns |

Over budget = checkpoint and re-classify before continuing. Budgets are planning heuristics, not a hard stop when competent review requires broader coverage.

**ACT** - MUST declare: `State: [MODE] | Goal: [one line] | Exit: [condition]`

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| Plan | Produce artefact only. File writes (e.g. milestone files) only on explicit approval. Exit on LGTM |
| Implement | Edit in 2-3 turns. 4th read without writing = checkpoint or re-scope |
| Explain | Walkthrough only. No changes unless asked |
| Debug | Diagnosis with file:line first. Fixes after human reviews |
| Review | Investigate first. Never blindly apply suggestions |

**VERIFY** - MUST run `shellcheck` on .sh changes. MUST check cross-references after renames. If working from a plan/milestone file, MUST tick `- [x]` on each task as it's completed - not at the end.

**Hallucination red-flags:**
1. **Tests pass.** Do not claim tests pass without showing the actual terminal output, or at minimum the literal pass/fail summary line copied verbatim from this session's run. A paraphrase, or a cached or prior-session pass, does not count.
2. **Completion.** Do not claim completion without listing the specific files changed in this turn. If no files were changed, say so explicitly.
3. **Fix verification.** Do not claim a fix works without running the reproduction steps that originally demonstrated the bug. "Looks correct" is not verification.
4. **Hedged claims.** Do not use "should work", "probably fine", "looks good" as verification. These are guesses, not evidence.
5. **Check passed.** Do not claim a check passed (shellcheck, typecheck, preflight, audit) without showing the command and its output in the same turn - verbatim output, or at minimum the literal pass/fail line copied from it.

- Level 1 (isolated): note, continue. Level 2 (cross-doc, broken refs, evidence): MUST full stop, wait for human
- Two corrections on same approach = MUST rewind
- Recovery: missing context → read first. Out-of-scope → name boundary, redirect. Conflicting sources → flag, ask.

If VERIFY caught a failure or you corrected course, update the learning loop before DoD: behavioural mistakes go in `.goat-flow/lessons/<category>.md`, cross-doc architectural traps go in `.goat-flow/footguns/<category>.md` with `**Status:** active | **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED`, significant technical decisions go in `.goat-flow/decisions/`, and optional continuity notes go in `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/`.

## Artifact Routing

When asked to add, create, or update a goat-flow artifact, route it to the artifact directory, not runtime code: footguns -> `.goat-flow/footguns/<category>.md`; lessons -> `.goat-flow/lessons/<category>.md`; decisions -> `.goat-flow/decisions/ADR-NNN.md`; patterns -> `.goat-flow/patterns/<category>.md`. Before editing, read the target directory's `README.md`; do not treat artifact requests as runtime-code requests unless the user explicitly asks for code too.

## Autonomy Tiers

**Always:** Read any file, run validation scripts, edit within declared scope, add Codex artifacts. Session logs at `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/` are OPTIONAL continuity notes - write one when `/compact` fires without an active milestone file, otherwise skip. Learning-loop updates (lessons/footguns/decisions) follow the conditional rule above: update only when VERIFY caught a failure or you corrected course.

**Codex note:** `goat-critique` depends on delegated sub-agents; direct `$goat-critique` or `/goat-critique` invocation is explicit delegation consent. Ask only when `goat-critique` is auto-routed or chained without a direct user request.

**Ask First** - before proceeding, state: boundary touched, related code read (yes/no), footgun entry checked (or "none"), local instruction checked (`.github/instructions/` / `AGENTS.md` / none), rollback command.

Boundaries: `.goat-flow/architecture.md`, this file (`AGENTS.md`), other instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`), generated-output templates under `workflow/setup/` or `workflow/skills/`, `workflow/manifest.json`, `src/cli/server/terminal.ts`, `src/cli/server/dashboard.ts`, `.goat-flow/skill-reference/`, CI under `.github/workflows/**` or `.github/actions/**`, Copilot runtime surfaces under `.github/hooks/**`, `.github/skills/**`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, agent runtime dirs `.claude/**`, `.codex/**`, `.gemini/**`, `.agents/**`, file adds/removes/renames, and changes spanning 3+ docs/scripts.

**Never:** Delete docs without replacement, invent incidents or evidence, edit secrets, commit unless asked, push, run destructive git commands, claim verification passed without running it. Overwrite existing files without checking destination (`ls` before `mv`/`cp`/Write; use `mv -n`). If interrupted or told no changes, freeze writes; run only read-only status/diff checks until the user explicitly asks for cleanup, revert, or apply.

## Definition of Done
MUST confirm ALL: (1) lint/typecheck passes on changed files (shellcheck on .sh, npm run typecheck on .ts) (2) no broken cross-references introduced (3) no unapproved boundary changes (4) logs updated if tripped (5) working notes current (6) grep old pattern after renames

## Working Memory
If working from a plan/milestone file, tick `- [x]` on each completed task immediately - not at the end. If context drifts or two approaches fail, restate scope and start fresh.

## Hard Rules
- If file exists, modify in-place. NEVER create `_modified`, `_new`, `_backup`, `_v2` variants.
- Severity: SECURITY > CORRECTNESS > INTEGRATION > PERFORMANCE > STYLE
- MUST maintain cross-file consistency: same concept, same description everywhere
- MUST preserve file evidence in footguns and examples. Use grep-friendly semantic anchors (function name, unique string, `(search: "pattern")`), not line numbers (per ADR-024).
- MUST use real incidents, never hypothetical. `.goat-flow/architecture.md` is canonical source of truth
- Sub-agents: ONE objective, structured return (paths, evidence, confidence, next step), 5-call budget. Blocked → one question with recommended default.
