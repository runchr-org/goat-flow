# GEMINI.md - v1.2.2 (2026-04-21)
Documentation framework for AI coding agent workflows. Markdown docs + Bash validation scripts + TypeScript CLI/dashboard.
## Essential Commands

```bash
shellcheck scripts/*.sh scripts/maintenance/*.sh                                            # Lint shell scripts
bash -n scripts/*.sh scripts/maintenance/*.sh                                                # Syntax-check scripts
bash .gemini/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test  # Verify deny-hook runtime behaviour
npm run typecheck                                   # Type-check .ts (required by DoD)
bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh         # Full preflight gate
npm test                                          # Run test suite
node --import tsx src/cli/cli.ts stats . --check  # Learning-loop health: last_reviewed + stale refs
```
## Truth Order

1. User's explicit instruction (this session)
2. Instruction file (GEMINI.md)
3. Architecture (.goat-flow/architecture.md)
4. Skills / templates (on-demand context)

## Execution Loop: READ → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY

**READ** - MUST read relevant files before changes. Never fabricate codebase facts. Cross-doc: MUST read all files describing the same concept. Use grep-first retrieval across `.goat-flow/footguns/`, `.goat-flow/lessons/`, and `.goat-flow/patterns.md`; open matching entries only, reword once on zero hits, then record a retrieval miss instead of broad-loading a bucket.
```
BAD:  "The CLI has 20 audit checks" (guessed without reading)
GOOD: Read src/cli/audit/check-goat-flow.ts → 13 setup checks, check-agent-setup.ts → 4 agent checks (17 total)
```

**SCOPE** - Three signals before acting: (1) Intent: question → answer it, directive → act on it. (2) Complexity + budgets (below). (3) Mode: Plan / Implement / Explain / Debug / Review. MUST declare before acting: files allowed to change, non-goals, max blast radius. Expanding beyond scope = stop and re-scope with human.

| Complexity | Typical read budget | Typical turn budget |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Hotfix | 2 reads | 3 turns |
| Standard Feature | 4 reads | 10 turns |
| System Change | 6 reads | 20 turns |
| Infrastructure | 8 reads | 25 turns |

Over budget = checkpoint and re-classify before continuing. Budgets are heuristics, not a hard stop when competent review needs broader coverage.

**ACT** - MUST declare: `State: [MODE] | Goal: [one line] | Exit: [condition]`

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| Plan | Produce artefact only. File writes (e.g. milestone files) only on explicit approval. Exit on LGTM |
| Implement | Edit in 2-3 turns. 4th read without writing = stop |
| Explain | Walkthrough only. No changes unless asked |
| Debug | Diagnosis with file:line first. Fixes after human reviews |
| Review | Investigate first. Never blindly apply suggestions |

**VERIFY** - MUST run `shellcheck` on .sh changes and `npm run typecheck` on .ts changes. MUST check cross-references after renames. If working from a plan/milestone file, MUST tick `- [x]` on each task as it's completed - not at the end.

**Hallucination red-flags:**
1. **Tests pass.** Do not claim tests pass without showing the actual terminal output, or at minimum the literal pass/fail summary line copied verbatim from this session's run. A paraphrase, or a cached or prior-session pass, does not count.
2. **Completion.** Do not claim completion without listing the specific files changed in this turn. If no files were changed, say so explicitly.
3. **Fix verification.** Do not claim a fix works without running the reproduction steps that originally demonstrated the bug. "Looks correct" is not verification.
4. **Hedged claims.** Do not use "should work", "probably fine", "looks good" as verification. These are guesses, not evidence.
5. **Check passed.** Do not claim a check passed (shellcheck, typecheck, preflight, audit) without showing the command and its output in the same turn - verbatim output, or at minimum the literal pass/fail line copied from it.

- Level 1 (isolated): note, continue. Level 2 (cross-doc, broken refs, evidence): MUST full stop, wait for human
- Two corrections on same approach = MUST rewind
- Recovery: missing context → read first. Out-of-scope → name boundary, redirect. Conflicting sources → flag, ask.

If VERIFY caught a failure or you corrected course, update the learning loop before DoD:
- Lessons: `.goat-flow/lessons/` category bucket files (e.g. `verification.md`, `agent-behavior.md`). Add `## Lesson: <name>` entry with `**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD` then content.
- Footguns: `.goat-flow/footguns/` category bucket files (e.g. `hooks.md`, `auditor.md`). Add `## Footgun: <name>` entry with `**Status:** active | **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED` then content with file:line evidence.

| File | When to update |
|------|---------------|
| `.goat-flow/lessons/` | Behavioural mistake (agent did something wrong) |
| `.goat-flow/footguns/` | Cross-doc architectural trap (with file:line evidence) |
| `.goat-flow/decisions/` | Significant technical decision with context/rationale |
| `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/` | Optional. On `/compact` without an active milestone file, write `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` continuity summary |

## Autonomy Tiers

**Always:** Read any file, lint scripts, edit within assigned scope. Session logs at `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/` are OPTIONAL continuity notes - write one when `/compact` fires without an active milestone file, otherwise skip. Learning-loop updates (lessons/footguns/decisions) follow the conditional rules above: update only when VERIFY caught a failure or you corrected course.

**Ask First** (MUST complete before proceeding):
- [ ] Boundary touched: [name]
- [ ] Related code read: [yes/no]
- [ ] Footgun entry checked: [relevant entry, or "none"]
- [ ] Local instruction checked: [local GEMINI.md / .github/instructions/ / none]
- [ ] Rollback command: [exact command]

Boundaries: `.goat-flow/architecture.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `workflow/setup/**`, `workflow/skills/**`, `workflow/manifest.json` (canonical agent inventory), `src/cli/server/terminal.ts` (PTY runtime), `src/cli/server/dashboard.ts` (local HTTP/WS server), `.github/workflows/**`, `.claude/**`, `.codex/**`, `.gemini/**`, `.agents/skills/`, renaming/moving files, 3+ doc file changes.

**Never:** Delete docs without replacement. Modify secrets/.env. Push to main. Change security config. Overwrite existing files without checking destination (`ls` before `mv`/`cp`/Write; use `mv -n`)

## Definition of Done

MUST confirm ALL: (1) lint/typecheck passes on changed files (shellcheck on .sh, npm run typecheck on .ts) (2) no broken cross-refs (3) no unapproved boundary changes (4) logs updated if tripped (5) working notes current (6) grep old pattern after renames.

## Hard Rules
- If file exists, modify in-place. NEVER create `_modified`, `_new`, `_backup`, `_v2` variants.
- Severity: SECURITY > CORRECTNESS > INTEGRATION > PERFORMANCE > STYLE
- MUST maintain cross-file consistency: same concept, same description everywhere
- MUST preserve file evidence in footguns and examples. Prefer grep-friendly semantic anchors; use `file:line` only when the line is the proof.
- MUST use real incidents, never hypothetical. `.goat-flow/architecture.md` is canonical source of truth
- Sub-agents: ONE objective, structured return (paths, evidence, confidence, next step), 5-call budget. Blocked → one question with recommended default.

## Working Memory
If working from a plan/milestone file, tick `- [x]` on each completed task immediately - not at the end.
Context health: compact at 60% util. Noise pruning before compacting. `/clear` between unrelated tasks.
