# Instruction File Sections

These sections go in every project's root instruction file (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or equivalent). They are generated from `docs/system-spec.md` and kept in sync with it.

**MULTI-AGENT SYNC:** When multiple agent files exist (CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + GEMINI.md), the execution loop content is duplicated in each (no import mechanism exists). Changes to the loop MUST be propagated to all copies. The scanner checks for divergence (check 3.3.4).

Target: under 120 lines. Hard limit: 150. Use BAD/GOOD examples not prose.

## Required Sections

```
a) Version header (v1.0 - YYYY-MM-DD)

b) Default Execution Loop: READ → CLASSIFY → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY → LOG
   - READ: read relevant files first, never fabricate codebase facts
     (include BAD/GOOD example)
     Cross-doc: MUST read docs/footguns/ before modifying files
     listed in the Ask First boundaries. Known traps prevent repeat mistakes.
   - CLASSIFY: three signals before acting:
     1. Intent: question (answer it) vs directive (act on it)
     2. Complexity tiers: Hotfix (1-2 files) / Small Feature (compressed brief) /
        Standard / System Change / Infrastructure.
        No fixed read/turn caps. If reads exceed 3x your initial estimate,
        re-classify before continuing.
     3. Mode: Plan / Implement / Explain / Debug / Review
   - SCOPE: declare before acting - files allowed to change, non-goals,
     max blast radius. Expanding beyond scope = stop and re-scope
   - ACT: behaviour per mode as a table. State declaration rule.
     Mode-transition rule: "Switching to [NEW STATE] because [reason]."
     Debug mode: "No fixes until human reviews diagnosis."
     Anti-planning-loop rule. Anti-BDUF guard with BAD/GOOD example
   - VERIFY: continuous test loop. Stop-the-line with two-level
     escalation. Revert-and-rescope tactic.
     Plan tracking: if working from a plan/milestone file, tick each
     checkbox (`- [x]`) as the task is completed - not at the end.
     Recovery protocols: include 2-3 common failure patterns with fixes
     (e.g., missing context → read X first, out-of-scope → name boundary
     and redirect, conflicting instructions → flag and ask)
   - LOG: MUST update when tripped (DoD gate #4). Use category bucket
     files - do NOT append to a monolithic log and do NOT create one
     file per incident forever.
     Lessons: `ai/lessons/` or `.goat-flow/lessons/` using category
     files such as `verification.md` with frontmatter `category`, then
     `## Lesson:` / `## Pattern:` entries inside.
     Footguns: `docs/footguns/` or `.goat-flow/footguns/` using
     category files such as `hooks.md` with frontmatter `category`,
     then `## Footgun:` entries with Status/Created/Evidence type
     inside. Decisions: `ai/decisions/`.
     When-to-use table. Footgun propagation rule.
     Context-based loading rules.
     MECHANICAL TRIGGER (non-negotiable):
     - VERIFY caught a failure in your code → `ai/lessons/` entry BEFORE DoD
     - Human corrected agent behaviour → `ai/lessons/` entry IMMEDIATELY
     - Discovered architectural trap with file:line evidence → `docs/footguns/`
     Skip = DoD gate #4 blocks completion. This is not optional.
     Session logs: write a summary to `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
     at the end of every significant session. Include: what happened, files changed,
     decisions made, errors, learnings, next steps.
     Dual-agent projects: learning loop files are shared. Read the
     current file before appending to avoid duplicating entries.

c) Autonomy Tiers: Always / Ask First / Never
   - Never tier MUST include:
     1. Overwrite existing files without checking destination (ls before
        mv/cp/Write; use mv -n). Data destruction from blind overwrites
        is unrecoverable for untracked files.
     2. Delete, move, or overwrite 5+ files in one operation without
        first listing targets (ls/find/echo glob) and getting explicit
        confirmation. Bulk deletes are irreversible for untracked files.
   - Adapt Ask First boundaries for THIS project's specific risks
   - Include Ask First checklist. Choose SHORT or FULL form:
     SHORT (2 questions — recommended for most projects):
     1. What else depends on this? [list callers/consumers]
     2. How do I undo this? [exact rollback command]
     FULL (5 items — for high-risk codebases, PHI, or multi-tenant systems):
     1. Boundary touched: [name it]
     2. Related code read: [yes/no]
     3. Footgun entry checked: [relevant entry, or "none"]
     4. Local instruction checked: [local instruction file / .github/instructions/ / none]
     5. Rollback command: [exact command]
   For multi-agent projects, consider extending AGENTS.md with domain
   concepts, key patterns, and deprecation warnings. AGENTS.md can serve
   double duty as execution protocol + domain reference - but watch the
   line budget.

d) Definition of Done: 6 gates
   (1) lint/typecheck passes on changed files
   (2) no broken cross-references introduced
   (3) no unapproved boundary changes
   (4) logs updated if tripped
   (5) working notes current
   (6) grep old pattern after renames

e) Working Memory: Working Notes for 5+ turn tasks, context escalation
   ladder, session handoff protocol. Incomplete work → copy
   .goat-flow/tasks/handoff-template.md to .goat-flow/tasks/handoff.md and fill in.
   Next session MUST read .goat-flow/tasks/handoff.md if it exists.
   Multi-task sessions: re-read the instruction file constraints before starting.
   Context health: compact at 60% utilization (not 90%). Remove
   failed attempts and superseded reasoning before compacting (noise
   pruning). Clear context between unrelated tasks when the agent supports it.
   .goat-flow/tasks/todo.md and .goat-flow/tasks/handoff.md MUST be gitignored.
   Agent-local settings (e.g., .claude/settings.local.json): review
   quarterly, prune session artifacts.
   Recommended: register a Notification hook for compaction that
   re-injects current task, modified files, and constraints.
   See workflow/runtime/enforcement.md for the hook configuration.

f) Sub-Agent Objectives: one focused objective, structured return,
   5-call budget

g) Communication When Blocked: one question with recommended default

h) Router table: MUST include at minimum:
     - All 6 skill directories (Claude/Gemini/Codex/Copilot: .claude/skills/, .agents/skills/, .github/skills/)
     - Learning loop directories (`docs/footguns/`, `.goat-flow/footguns/`, `ai/lessons/`, `.goat-flow/lessons/`)
     - Architecture doc, handoff template, agent evals
     - Project guidelines: `ai/README.md`
     - Any playbooks, profiles, or domain docs relevant to project
     Dual-agent projects: router MUST include the other agent's
     instruction file (AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md).
     (Unrouted files are invisible to the agent - 160x usage uplift
     for referenced tools)

i) Essential commands

If over line target, apply cut priority from the system spec.
If you must weaken a MUST to meet the line target, the target is
wrong - raise it, don't weaken the rule.
Do NOT skip sections (f)–(i) - they are small but required.

When sources conflict, this precedence applies:
1. User's explicit instruction (this session)
2. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (always-loaded instruction file)
3. setup/shared/execution-loop.md (shared template)
4. docs/system-spec.md (canonical reference)
5. Skills / playbooks (on-demand context)
```
