## Lesson: Agents given broad setup tasks rewrite shared docs as agent-specific

**Created:** 2026-03-21

**What happened:** Gemini CLI was asked to set up GOAT Flow. It modified 6 shared documentation files (`docs/system-spec.md` (retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/setup/shared/system-overview.md`), `docs/five-layers.md` (retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/setup/shared/system-overview.md`), `docs/design-rationale.md` (retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/setup/shared/system-overview.md`), `docs/getting-started.md` (retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/setup/`), `workflow/runtime/enforcement.md` (retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/hooks/`), and skill files), replacing Claude Code references with Gemini-specific equivalents. The skills table in `docs/five-layers.md` had its Claude Code row deleted. The enforcement template ended up in a hybrid state - half `.claude/` paths, half `.gemini/` paths.

**Prevention:** Agent setup prompts must include explicit scope constraints. For Gemini: "Only create/modify files under `.gemini/` and `GEMINI.md`. Do NOT modify `docs/`, `workflow/`, or any file outside the `.gemini/` directory." For any agent: treat shared documentation as a boundary that requires Ask First permission.

## Lesson: Setup agents propagate errors from existing instruction files

**Created:** 2026-03-22

**What happened:** Rampart's CLAUDE.md had `redaction.rs` (doesn't exist - redaction is Python only). Blundergoat's CLAUDE.md had a stale web middleware path pointing at `middleware.ts` instead of `proxy.ts`, plus a stale API SQL directory pointing at `migrations/` instead of `schema/`. Sub-agents creating `ai-docs/coding-standards/` read these wrong paths from the existing instruction files and copied them into the new cold-path files, propagating the error.
**Root cause:** The verification gate said "verify paths in ai-docs/coding-standards/" but didn't say "also audit the existing instruction file you're reading from." Agents trust the hot-path file as authoritative without checking.
**Fix:** Added "ALSO AUDIT EXISTING INSTRUCTION FILES" gate to docs-seed.md - verify Ask First paths exist, check router entries resolve, fix stale paths before copying them into cold-path files.

## Lesson: Agents under line pressure cut "small but required" sections

**Created:** 2026-03-20

**What happened:** Both rampart and sus-form-detector agents dropped Sub-Agent Objectives (f) and Communication When Blocked (g) when compressing CLAUDE.md toward the line target. The instructions said "Do NOT skip sections (f)-(i)" but only in Prompt B - Prompt A (used for new projects) didn't have this warning.

**Prevention:** Every constraint that agents are likely to cut under pressure must appear in BOTH the template (execution-loop.md) AND the prompt that invokes it (Prompt A in setup-claude.md). A rule in only one place is a rule that gets missed.

## Lesson: Agents resolve contradictions by following whichever source they read first

**Created:** 2026-03-20

**What happened:** `docs/system-spec.md` (retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/setup/shared/execution-loop.md`) showed the old 5-step execution loop while execution-loop.md had the updated 6-step version with SCOPE. The setup prompt said "Read docs/system-spec.md" first. Both rampart and sus-form-detector agents absorbed the spec's loop and either didn't notice or couldn't override execution-loop.md. 7 of 8 gaps in sus-form-detector traced to this single contradiction.

**Prevention:** When updating any concept that appears in multiple files, update the file agents read FIRST before or at the same time as the authoritative source. Never assume agents will reconcile contradictions - they follow the first version they encounter. The retirement of `docs/system-spec.md` in v1.1.0 eliminates this specific duplication, but the general principle remains.

## Lesson: Removing a concept requires full-repo grep, not just code grep

**Created:** 2026-03-22

**What happened:** Shape removed from scanner code (ADR-002) but `[APP / LIBRARY / SCRIPT COLLECTION]` survived in 9 setup/workflow/doc files. Confusion-log removed (ADR-003) but agent recreated it because the constraint wasn't in the prompt.
**Root cause:** Grepped `src/` and `test/` but not `workflow/setup/`, `workflow/`, `docs/`.
**Fix:** Preflight now enforces removed patterns across all live directories. ADR removals must grep the entire repo.

## Pattern: Skill consolidation requires a full grep after every merge

**Created:** 2026-03-30

**What happened:** Consolidated 9 skills to 6 (v0.9.3). Updated .claude/skills, scanner constants, test fixtures, docs, evals. Missed: .agents/skills still had old skill content, .github/skills still had old dirs, 16+ files still said "9 skills", setup fragments still referenced old skill names, CI still validated old skill list. External reviewers found all of these. Required 3 rounds of fixes.

**Root cause:** Treated skill merge as "delete old dirs + update a few constants." Didn't grep for ALL references to old skill names across the full repo. The same lesson as "Removing a concept requires full-repo grep" but at a larger scale.

**Prevention:** After any skill rename/merge/delete: (1) grep entire repo for every old name, (2) check all 3 agent dirs (.claude/, .agents/, .github/), (3) check scanner constants + types + anti-patterns + fragments + template-refs, (4) check test fixtures, (5) run the full test suite + scanner. Don't trust "it builds and tests pass" - read the changed files.

## Lesson: mv/rename overwrites destination file without checking if it exists

**Created:** 2026-03-21

**What happened:** User asked to rename `TODO_improvements_v0.3.md` to `TODO_improvements_v0.4.md`. Agent ran `mv v0.3 v0.4` without checking that v0.4 already existed. The mv overwrote v0.4 with v0.3's content. When the user said "undo", the agent moved v0.4 (now containing v0.3's content) back to v0.3, destroying v0.4's original content entirely. The file was untracked by git and unrecoverable.

**Prevention:** Before any `mv`, `cp`, or Write that targets an existing path, MUST run `ls` on the destination first. If the destination exists, stop and ask the user. This applies to all file operations that can overwrite - not just mv. Add to the Never tier: "Overwrite existing files without confirming destination is safe."
