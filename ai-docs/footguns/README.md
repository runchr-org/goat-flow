# Footguns

**Traps in the code itself.** A footgun exists whether or not an agent triggers it — it's a property of how the codebase is structured. Example: "renaming one doc breaks 5 others because of dense cross-referencing." The trap is in the architecture, not in what the agent did.

If the agent did something wrong → `ai-docs/lessons/` instead.

Every entry MUST include file path evidence. Line numbers are optional historical context — they rot and don't need updating.

Prefer category bucket files such as `hooks.md`, `setup.md`, or `scanner.md` with file-level frontmatter:

```yaml
---
category: hooks
---
```

Inside a bucket, add entries as `## Footgun:` blocks. Legacy single-entry files still work during migration, but category buckets are the preferred format.
