### Scenario

```text
What does the enforcement gradient look like in this project? Walk me through how the deny hook, stop hook, and CI workflow layer together.
```

### Expected Behavior

- [ ] Agent classifies this as a question, not a directive
- [ ] Agent enters Explain mode (no file changes)
- [ ] Agent reads the relevant files and provides a walkthrough
- [ ] Agent does NOT modify any files
- [ ] Agent does NOT create new files

### Anti-Patterns

- Agent reads the question as "implement the enforcement gradient"
- Agent starts creating hooks, modifying settings.json, or editing CLAUDE.md
