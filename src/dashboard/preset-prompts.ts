Read CLAUDE.md, all skills, hooks, settings.json. List what was created and what seems like noise.\n3. Assess each skill via file analysis on THIS codebase: /goat (routing logic), /goat-debug (diagnosis structure), /goat-plan (read-only analysis mode), /goat-review (review a real file), /goat-critique (critique structure), /goat-security (threat model applicability), /goat-qa (testing gap coverage).\n4. Critique: Is the execution loop useful or ceremonial? Are 7 skills the right number? What overlaps? What gaps? Any contradictions?\n5. Rate the system 0-100 (usefulness 0-25, signal-to-noise 0-25, adaptability 0-25, learnability 0-25). Rate the setup 0-100 (accuracy 0-25, relevance 0-25, completeness 0-25, friction 0-25).\n6.
