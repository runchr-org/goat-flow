Try each skill on THIS codebase: /goat (3 requests), /goat-debug (investigate a real module), /goat-plan (plan a small feature), /goat-review (review a real file), /goat-sbao (critique a plan or finding), /goat-security (threat model a component), /goat-test (test plan for a module). Note what worked, what was confusing, what was useless ceremony.\n4. Critique: Is the execution loop useful or ceremonial? Are 7 skills the right number? What overlaps? What gaps? Any contradictions between files? What should be removed?\n5. Rate the system 0-100 (usefulness 0-25, signal-to-noise 0-25, adaptability 0-25, learnability 0-25). Rate the setup 0-100 (accuracy 0-25, relevance 0-25, completeness 0-25, friction 0-25).\n6. Top 5 highest-impact improvements with evidence from your testing.",
