Skills not yet covered should each get one eval targeting their most common failure mode:
- **goat-debug**: agent proposes a fix before completing diagnosis; investigate mode: agent skips Step 0 and fabricates context
- **goat-plan**: agent continues a stale plan without re-reading context; refactor mode: agent over-scopes and touches unrelated files
- **goat-review**: agent misses a footgun during code review; simplify mode: agent removes logic it didn't understand
- **goat-security**: agent flags a framework-mitigated vulnerability as real

**Template:** Read \`workflow/hooks/context-validation.yml\` from the goat-flow package and copy it to your project's \`.github/workflows/\` directory.

Do NOT rename the step names - the scanner checks for these exact strings: "Check instruction file line counts", "Check router references", "Check skills exist".

If the template file is not available, create \`.github/workflows/context-validation.yml\` with these steps:
1. Check instruction file line counts (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md must be ≤150 lines)
2. Run \`bash scripts/context-validate.sh\` for router reference validation
3. Check that the 6 canonical skill directories exist: goat, goat-debug, goat-plan, goat-review, goat-security, goat-test`,

IMPORTANT: If writing inline shell instead of calling a script, do NOT use \`grep ... | while read\` - the pipe creates a subshell and error counts won't propagate. Use process substitution: \`while read ... done < <(grep ...)\` or write results to a temp file.`,

1. Diff the execution loop sections across all agent instruction files
2. Identify intentional differences (agent-specific adaptations) vs accidental drift
3. Reconcile: same rules should use same wording, agent-specific behaviour stays different
4. After reconciling, verify essential commands and Ask First boundaries are also consistent

Note: the execution loop MUST be duplicated (each file is loaded independently). The goal is consistency, not deduplication.`,
