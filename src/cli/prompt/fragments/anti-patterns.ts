    instruction: `**CRITICAL:** \`{{instructionFile}}\` is over 150 lines (hard limit). This is an anti-pattern that costs -3 points.

Immediate actions:
1. Remove verbose examples - keep one BAD/GOOD pair per concept
2. Replace paragraphs with bullet points
3. Move reference material to \`docs/\` and link from router table
4. Collapse multi-row tables into inline text where possible

Target: under 120 lines. Hard limit: 150.`,

Remove the DoD from the guidelines file. The DoD belongs only in \`{{instructionFile}}\`.`,

    category: 'Anti-Pattern Fix',
    kind: 'fix',
    instruction: `**CRITICAL:** footgun entries under \`docs/footguns/\` or \`.goat-flow/footguns/\` lack file:line evidence. This is an anti-pattern that costs -5 points.

For every footgun entry, add at least one \`file:line\` reference:

**Before:** "The auth module has race conditions"
**After:** "\`src/auth.ts:42\` - race condition between token refresh and request dispatch"

If the evidence no longer applies (code changed), either update the reference or remove the footgun.`,

1. Open the file and find the syntax error
2. Common issues: trailing commas, missing quotes, unescaped backslashes
3. Validate with: \`node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('{{settingsFile}}', 'utf8'))"\``,

Fix: ensure the last line of the script is \`exit 0\`. If the script has conditional exits, ensure ALL code paths reach \`exit 0\`.`,

Replace with project-specific boundaries using actual file paths:

**Before:** "auth, routing, deployment, API, DB"

- \`src/auth/\` - authentication module (cross-cutting)

Either:
1. **Populate** - search git history for real incidents: \`git log --oneline | grep -iE 'fix|revert|bug|broke|regression'\`. Seed from real mistakes only.
2. **Or remove** - delete the empty files. Let them materialise on first real use.

Empty scaffolding provides no value and creates a false sense of completeness.`,

**Outdated skills:** {{evidence.ap-fix-outdated-skills}}

For each outdated skill:
1. Read the current template from goat-flow (\`workflow/skills/goat-{name}.md\`)
2. Compare against your installed version - look for new sections, renamed phases, or structural changes
3. Update the skill content to match the current template structure
4. Add or update the frontmatter version tag:

\`\`\`yaml
---
name: goat-{name}
goat-flow-skill-version: "${SKILL_VERSION}"
---
\`\`\`

After updating all skills:
5. Verify the router table in CLAUDE.md (and AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md) references all 6 canonical skills and no non-existent paths
6. If \`.github/workflows/context-validation.yml\` exists, verify its skills check list matches the canonical set`,

**Dangling references:** {{evidence.ap-fix-dangling-skill-refs}}

For each dangling reference:
1. Check if the file was renamed or moved - update the path if so

Common stale directories to remove:
- \`goat-investigate\` → merged into goat-debug (investigate mode)
- \`goat-audit\` → merged into goat-review (audit mode)
- \`goat-onboard\` → merged into goat-debug (onboard mode)
- \`goat-reflect\` → merged into goat-review (instruction mode)
- \`goat-resume\` → removed (handled by agent context)
- \`goat-simplify\` → merged into goat-review (simplify mode)
- \`goat-refactor\` → merged into goat-plan (refactor mode)
- \`goat-context\` → removed
- \`audit/\`, \`review/\`, \`preflight/\` → replaced by goat-* skills

After deleting, update the router table in your instruction file to reference only the 6 canonical skills.`,
