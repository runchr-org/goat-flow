/**
 * Manifest schema for goat-flow's single source of truth (M06a).
 *
 * `workflow/manifest.json` is the on-disk form. `loadManifest()` returns a
 * resolved `Manifest` where every `facts` field has been computed against
 * canonical code sources (SETUP_CHECKS, AGENT_CHECKS, HARNESS_CHECKS,
 * SKILL_NAMES) or validated against observed on-disk state (dashboard views,
 * preset count).
 *
 * Derived values are never written into the JSON — they are computed at load
 * time so `facts` cannot drift from code. Static values are written into the
 * JSON and validated against observed reality on load; a mismatch raises a
 * `ManifestValidationError`.
