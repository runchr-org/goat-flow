/**
 * Cold-path content quality linting (M05 § 1).
 *
 * Three detector families, all running on truth-bearing prose (instruction
 * files, installed skills, canonical docs). Ports logic inline from cclint
 * and agnix (per Assumption "no new runtime deps"):
 *
 *   - Vague-term detection (3-term conservative subset: `properly`,
 *     `correctly`, `appropriately`). INFO severity.
 *   - Generic-instruction detection (5 cclint regex patterns, e.g.
 *     "follow best practices"). WARNING severity.
 *   - Non-actionable statement detection (3 cclint regex patterns with
 *     negative lookaheads, e.g. bare "remember" without "to"). INFO.
 *
 * Both cclint code-block-skipping bugs are fixed here (ContentOrganizationRule
 * and ContentAppropriatenessRule both leak fenced-block content into their
 * matchers). A single `inCodeBlock` state machine is shared across all three
 * detector families — toggled on lines starting with ``` (after trimming).
