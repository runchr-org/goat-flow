# ADR-045: No standalone goat-verify skill; use shared Proof Gate

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-04-18

## Context

During the v1.1.x review cycle the question arose whether goat-flow should add an 8th canonical skill called `goat-verify` to own verification / completion-claim discipline across the goat-* skills. Five independent analysis passes (one self, four external agents) were run over the same brief. Options considered:

1. Build standalone canonical `goat-verify` installed by default.
2. Do not build; add a shared Proof Gate to `skill-preamble.md` and patch existing skills.
3. Stage: shared gate now, promote to standalone skill only if duplication pressure persists.
4. Optional / non-canonical `goat-verify` outside the install set.

All 5 analyses converged on rejecting option 1. Evidence:

- Verification is already a first-class framework concern on the hot path (`AGENTS.md:51-58` hallucination red-flags + `AGENTS.md:95-96` DoD) and in cold-path shared doctrine (`.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md:23-33` Evidence Standard).
- Per-skill gates are domain-specific and heterogeneous by design: goat-debug confidence (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW = reproduced/traced/inferred), goat-security confidence (CONFIRMED/PROBABLE/THEORETICAL), goat-review severity tags `[MUST/SHOULD/MAY:patch/needs-decision]`, goat-plan per-milestone testing gates, goat-qa must/should/skip tiers. Collapsing them into a generic verifier would destroy information tuned to different consumers.
- There is no cross-skill verification routing today — each gate is bespoke and self-contained. A new routed skill would have no clean trigger space distinct from `/goat-debug` (bug-fix verification), `/goat-review` (diff/PR verification), `/goat-qa` (coverage verification), or the DoD, violating the CSO rule in `.goat-flow/glossary.md:16`.
- Prior ADRs establish precedent against this pattern:
  - **ADR-030** (skill consolidation) — new skills must have a distinct artifact or failure mode.
  - **ADR-019** (no implementation skill) — rejected the goat-doer / goat-verifier split; verification must come from fresh review/test invocations, not an artificial verifier layer over the same work.
  - **ADR-004** (replace preflight with security skill) — rejected "glorified checklist skill" in favour of strengthening real enforcement surfaces.
  - **ADR-042** (remove RULES.md) — moved duplicated always-on rules into `skill-preamble.md`. This is the sanctioned pattern for cross-cutting doctrine.
  - **ADR-017** (consolidate 9→6 skills) — repo trends toward fewer skills, not more.
- Measured blast radius of a new canonical skill: 3 hardcoded surfaces (`workflow/install-goat-flow.sh:140` `SKILL_NAMES` string, `src/cli/constants.ts:8-16` `SKILL_NAMES` array, `workflow/manifest.json:45-52` canonical list), plus audit-drift test count bump (`test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts:76`), plus 3-way installed-copy parity (`.goat-flow/footguns/skills.md:5-16` documents real punctuation-only drift incidents that proved parity is not free).

External pattern mining (superpowers/verification-before-completion, systematic-debugging, BMAD review decomposition, Archon debug/plan, claude-mem make-plan) yielded importable content for existing surfaces, not justification for a new skill. `SuperClaude_Framework/confidence-check` (≥90% numeric gate) was rejected across all 5 analyses as incompatible with goat-flow's evidence-over-hedges culture — a numeric confidence score is itself a hedge forbidden by `AGENTS.md:55` red-flag #4.

## Decision

1. **No standalone `goat-verify` skill.** Skill count stays at 7. `workflow/manifest.json`, `src/cli/constants.ts`, `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh`, and the `test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts:76` literal count stay unchanged.

2. **Shared Proof Gate in the preamble.** Add a `## Proof Gate` section to `workflow/skills/reference/skill-preamble.md` (and installed copy `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md`) after `## Evidence Standard`. The Proof Gate names the positive procedure (Identify → Run fresh → Read → Verify → Cite) that substantiates claims. It is the complement to the 5 hallucination red-flags, which name the violations.

3. **Routing hygiene — stop goat-qa from over-claiming "verify".** Update `skill-preamble.md` routing from "Testing gaps, coverage, verification → /goat-qa" to "Testing gaps, coverage, verification planning → /goat-qa". Update `goat-qa/SKILL.md` quick-mode trigger from `"verify"` to `"verify coverage"`. Add explicit redirection lines in `goat-qa`'s "NOT this skill" block: bug-fix verification → `/goat-debug`, diff/PR verification → `/goat-review`, completion certification → Proof Gate.

4. **One-line Proof Gate reference at each skill's primary claim-making moment.** Add a short reference to the Proof Gate in each of the 7 skills' handoff / BLOCKING GATE / DoD / milestone-close positions so the reminder fires pedagogically, not only as inherited policy.

5. **Targeted imports into `goat-debug`** (not a new skill):
   - Multi-component boundary instrumentation in D1 (from `superpowers/systematic-debugging:72-107`).
   - Causation / Necessity / Sufficiency validation gate and 5-Whys-with-`file:line` in D2 (from `Archon/cookbooks/debug.md:71-95, 151-159`).
   - 3-fix abort rule and rerun-original-repro requirement in D4 (from `superpowers/systematic-debugging:195-213`).
   - Proof Gate reference in D4.

6. **Capture the one genuinely new behavioural insight as a lesson.** Rationalization anti-patterns ("Confidence ≠ evidence", "Just this once", "Partial check is enough", etc.) go into `.goat-flow/lessons/verification.md` as a new `## Lesson:` entry. This is the excuse-pattern catalog the red-flags do not explicitly enumerate.

7. **Deterministic text-contract tests.** Extend `test/integration/preamble-sync.test.ts` to assert the `## Proof Gate` heading exists in both preamble copies. Add `test/integration/verification-boundaries.test.ts` to pin: goat-qa trigger does not claim raw `"verify"`; preamble routing says "verification planning"; every canonical skill references "Proof Gate".

## Consequences

- **Blast radius contained.** No canonical-skill-count changes. No edits to `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh`, `src/cli/constants.ts`, `workflow/manifest.json`, or `test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts:76`. The 3 hardest drift surfaces stay untouched.
- **Hot/cold path distinction preserved.** Hot path (`AGENTS.md`) remains within its 150-line budget (`.goat-flow/architecture.md:59-61`). Cold-path shared doctrine (`skill-preamble.md`) absorbs the new Proof Gate following the ADR-042 pattern.
- **Verification discipline strengthens without routing complexity.** Every skill's output moment is governed by the Proof Gate via inheritance plus an explicit one-line reference, while each skill retains domain-specific gate semantics (confidence scales, severity tags, testing gates).
- **Rollback is trivial.** Revert the preamble Proof Gate section, the one-line references in 7 skills, the goat-debug domain patches, the lesson entry, and this ADR. No persisted state (config, manifest, constants) to unwind. Single `git revert` discharges the change.

## Revisit Triggers

Open a new ADR to promote to standalone `goat-verify` only if, after this rollout has shipped and been used for at least one release cycle:

1. Three or more recurring completion-without-evidence incidents occur that the red-flags and Proof Gate together did not catch (logged as entries in `.goat-flow/lessons/verification.md`).
2. Three or more distinct skills independently develop a ≥15-line identical verification procedure (true shared logic, not wording overlap).
3. A new intent space emerges that is concretely distinct from `/goat-debug`, `/goat-review`, `/goat-qa`, `/goat-security`, `/goat-plan`, and `/goat-critique`, reported by real usage — not hypothesized.

If any precondition fires, the new ADR's implementation must touch the 3 hardcoded surfaces (install script, constants, manifest), add a canonical entry, bump the audit-drift count, and pass 3-way-copy parity. That cost is the reason this ADR refused them today.
