# ADR-036: Remove scanner/rubric system, drive setup from audit

**Date:** 2026-04-13
**Status:** Accepted
**Supersedes:** Earlier draft that proposed keeping both systems

## Context

goat-flow has two separate evaluation engines:

1. **Scanner/rubric** (`src/cli/rubric/`, `src/cli/scanner/`, `src/cli/scoring/`) — 79 rubric checks (28 foundation + 51 standard) + 12 anti-patterns. Point-based scoring with tiers, categories, and deductions. Originally the only evaluation system. The `scan` command was removed in v1.1.0 but the engine remains, called by `setup` (`cli.ts:496` → `scanProject()`), `info rubrics`, `info anti-patterns`, and the dashboard `/api/setup` endpoint.

2. **Audit** (`src/cli/audit/`) — 15 build checks (10 setup + 5 harness, pass/fail) + 25 quality checks (advisory percentage). Deterministic. User-facing via `goat-flow audit`. Powers CI gates, dashboard `/api/audit`, and critique prompt generation.

Seven-agent critique exposed the consequences of running both:
- Setup says "All audit checks pass" while running scanner checks (`compose-setup.ts:153` vs `cli.ts:496`)
- Setup reports "14 hooks" by counting scanner rubric category hits, not actual hook files (`compose-setup.ts:172`)
- On broken repos, setup drops into scanner vocabulary ("5 checks need attention out of 79 total", "Anti-Pattern Fixes") — different from the audit model users see everywhere else
- CONTRIBUTING.md sends contributors to `src/cli/rubric/` when they want `src/cli/audit/`
- `info rubrics` outputs 79 checks while `audit` shows 15+25 — no doc bridges these
- architecture.md claims "~165 rubric checks" (stale count) alongside "15 build + 25 quality checks" (correct) on the same line

The scanner served its purpose as the original evaluation engine. The audit system replaced it for all public-facing use. The scanner is now dead weight that creates confusion.

## Decision

Delete the scanner/rubric system entirely. Make audit the single evaluation engine driving all goat-flow commands including setup.

## Setup Flow After Migration

Setup uses `classifyProjectState()` for routing and `runAudit()` for validation. The scanner's 5-mode percentage routing (100%, 90-99%, 50-89%, <50%) collapses to a simpler model:

```
setup --agent claude
  → classifyProjectState(fs, "claude")
    → bare/partial      → full setup guide (stack from detectStack(), steps from workflow/setup/)
    → v0.9/v1.0         → redirect to upgrade guide
    → v1.1              → runAudit(fs, path, { agentFilter: "claude" })
      → PASS            → success message with real counts from extractProjectFacts()
      → FAIL            → list failing checks with howToFix + reference to relevant setup steps
```

**Key architectural insight:** `extractProjectFacts()` (`src/cli/facts/orchestrator.ts`) is shared infrastructure used by both systems. Stack detection (`detectStack()`), agent enumeration, hook/skill/config facts all come from facts, not from the scanner. Setup can call facts directly for context without `scanProject()`.

**What replaces the scanner's repair guidance:** Each audit build check has a `howToFix` field (defined in `src/cli/audit/build-checks.ts`). When a check fails, setup renders the check name + howToFix instruction + reference to the numbered setup step that addresses it. This replaces the scanner's 100+ fragment lookup system with direct, per-check guidance.

## Dependency Analysis

**scanProject() call sites (only 2):**
- `src/cli/cli.ts:496` — setup command
- `src/cli/server/dashboard.ts:315` — `/api/setup` endpoint

**RUBRIC_VERSION dependency:** `src/cli/audit/build-checks.ts:9` imports `RUBRIC_VERSION` from `rubric/version.ts`. This is the only audit→rubric dependency. Fix: derive version from `package.json` (already done at runtime) or move constant to `src/cli/constants.ts`.

**Audit system independence:** `src/cli/audit/` has zero imports from rubric/, scanner/, or scoring/ except the RUBRIC_VERSION constant above. The audit system is ready to be the sole evaluation engine.

**Facts extraction independence:** `src/cli/facts/orchestrator.ts` is consumed by both systems but depends on neither. It provides: `stack` (languages, commands, signals), `agents` (per-agent instruction, settings, skills, hooks), `shared` (footguns, lessons, config, decisions).

## What Gets Removed

**Directories (3):**
- `src/cli/rubric/` — foundation.ts, standard/, anti-patterns.ts, registry.ts, version.ts
- `src/cli/scanner/` — scan.ts, evaluate-check.ts
- `src/cli/scoring/` — calculate.ts, recommendations.ts

**Prompt fragments (3 files):**
- `src/cli/prompt/fragments/foundation.ts` — rubric-tied fix fragments
- `src/cli/prompt/fragments/standard.ts` — rubric-tied fix fragments
- `src/cli/prompt/fragments/anti-patterns.ts` — anti-pattern fix fragments

**CLI commands (2):**
- `info rubrics` (with helpful removal message)
- `info anti-patterns` (with helpful removal message)

**Types from `src/cli/types.ts` (~12 types):**
- CheckDef, AntiPatternDef, CheckResult (scanner version), AntiPatternResult
- TierScore, ScoreSummary, Recommendation, AgentReport, ScanReport
- CheckStatus, Tier, Confidence, Grade (scanner-specific)

**Test files:**
- `test/unit/scanner-foundations.test.ts` — tests rubric registry
- Scanner-related assertions in other test files

**Exports from `src/cli/index.ts`:**
- `getCheck`, `getChecksByTier`, `getChecksByCategory` (rubric registry functions)
- `ScanReport`, `CheckDef`, `AntiPatternDef` type re-exports

## What Gets Rewritten

**`src/cli/prompt/compose-setup.ts`** (largest change):
- Currently 1300+ lines with 5 rendering modes keyed to scanner percentages
- Rewrite to 3 modes: full-setup (bare/partial), upgrade-redirect (v0.9/v1.0), audit-driven (v1.1 pass/fail)
- Success path: real counts from `extractProjectFacts()` (actual hook files, actual skill dirs)
- Failure path: failing audit checks with `howToFix` fields, mapped to setup step numbers
- Stack context: from `detectStack()` directly, not from ScanReport
- Removes: fragment lookups, percentage routing, anti-pattern rendering, recommendation arrays

**`src/cli/prompt/template-filler.ts`:**
- Update to extract variables from facts + audit results instead of ScanReport

**`src/cli/cli.ts`:**
- Setup handler: call `runAudit()` + `extractProjectFacts()` instead of `scanProject()`
- Remove `handleInfoCommand()` and `info` subcommand routing
- Remove `scanProject` import

**`src/cli/server/dashboard.ts`:**
- `/api/setup` endpoint: `runAudit()` + facts instead of `scanProject()`

**`src/cli/constants.ts`:**
- Move `RUBRIC_VERSION` here (or derive from package.json)

## What Stays Unchanged

- `src/cli/audit/` — build-checks.ts, quality-checks.ts, audit.ts, render.ts, types.ts
- `src/cli/facts/` — orchestrator.ts, fs.ts, agent/, shared/ (shared infrastructure)
- `src/cli/detect/` — agents.ts, project-stack.ts (shared infrastructure)
- `src/cli/config/` — reader.ts, types.ts
- `src/cli/prompt/fragments/full.ts` — promoted fragments (generic instructions, not rubric-tied)
- `src/cli/prompt/registry.ts` — fragment lookup (may need simplification)
- `goat-flow audit`, `goat-flow critique`, `goat-flow status`, `goat-flow dashboard`
- All existing audit and contract tests

## Rationale

- **One truth.** Users, contributors, and agents should see one evaluation model.
- **Setup should speak audit.** When a user runs `audit` and sees 10 setup checks, then runs `setup`, the repair guidance should reference those same 10 checks.
- **The scanner's granularity isn't needed.** Audit's `howToFix` + the 6 numbered setup steps provide the repair guidance. The 25 quality checks provide advisory depth. Between them, they cover what the scanner covered.
- **Facts extraction carries the context.** Stack detection, agent enumeration, and configuration state all come from `extractProjectFacts()` which is independent of both systems. Setup never needed the scanner for context — only for scoring.
- **Massive simplification.** compose-setup.ts collapses from 5 percentage-based modes with 100+ fragment lookups to 3 state-based modes with direct howToFix rendering.

## Risks

- **Setup repair prompts lose granularity.** The scanner's 79 checks gave per-rubric-point instructions. The audit's 15 checks are coarser. Mitigation: audit `howToFix` fields are specific and actionable; the 6 setup steps provide the detailed flow.
- **Breaking change for `info rubrics` consumers.** Mitigation: returns a helpful removal message (same pattern as `scan` removal).
- **Large diff.** Mitigation: scope as a dedicated milestone (M25-H or M26) with its own test gate.

## Consequences

- goat-flow has one evaluation system: audit (build checks + quality checks)
- Setup is driven by audit pass/fail for the specified agent
- compose-setup.ts simplifies from ~1300 lines to the minimum needed for 3 routing modes
- `info rubrics` and `info anti-patterns` are removed
- CONTRIBUTING.md, architecture.md, code-map.md, docs/cli.md all describe one system
- No scanner vocabulary appears in any user-facing surface
