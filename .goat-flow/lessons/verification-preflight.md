## Lesson: Formatter verification must preserve repo style flags

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-03

**What happened:** While tightening scanner messages, verification included a `prettier --write` pass on three rubric files without the repo's single-quote flag. The code was still valid, but the formatter rewrote quote style across entire files and created a much larger diff than intended.
**Root cause:** Treated formatting as a neutral cleanup step instead of part of the blast radius. The command matched the tool, but not the repo's existing style contract.
**Fix:** When formatting targeted files during verification, use the same style flags the repo already uses or the same invocation pattern that previous maintenance/test scripts used. Always check `git diff --stat` immediately after formatter runs to catch accidental blast-radius expansion.

**2026-04-25 amendment:** The same trap recurred on `docs/site/goat-flow-landing.html`: a targeted stale-copy edit plus broad `prettier --write` rewrote most of the hand-authored landing page. Keep formatter scopes to touched files that are already formatter-owned, and read `git diff --stat` before running expensive gates so formatting churn can be reverted before verification evidence is collected.

## Lesson: Repo-wide preflight can be blocked by unrelated formatter drift

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-18

**What happened:** After deleting the dedicated setup validator and rewiring preflight around the remaining script surface, focused verification passed (`shellcheck`, `npm run typecheck`, targeted smoke/unit tests, and exact grep for the removed path). But `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh` still failed because `scripts/prettier-check.sh` reported four unformatted files that were outside the change set: `src/cli/classify-state.ts`, `src/dashboard/app.ts`, `test/integration/preamble-sync.test.ts`, and `test/unit/quality-command.test.ts`.

**Root cause:** Preflight is repo-wide, not diff-scoped. A local task can leave its own files clean and still inherit unrelated formatter debt already present in the worktree or committed baseline. If that debt is not separated from task-local regressions, the final report becomes ambiguous about whether the task itself broke verification.

**Fix:** Format any touched files first, then rerun the focused checks. If preflight still fails, run the narrower verifier (`scripts/prettier-check.sh` or equivalent) to identify whether the remaining failures are in untouched files. Report that split explicitly instead of calling preflight a task regression.

**Recurrence update (2026-04-21):** A v1.2.2 version-bump run had `npm test` fail only because the installer round-trip fixture runs full preflight and found committed formatter drift in `src/dashboard/index.html`, a file outside the version-bump edit set. `npm run format:check` reproduced the same single-file failure.

**Recurrence update (2026-05-10):** PR #35 review-feedback fixes passed focused dashboard/terminal tests and `npm run typecheck`, but targeted `npx prettier --check ...` still failed on touched file `test/smoke/dashboard-endpoints.test.ts` after adding a terminal timing regression. Running `npx prettier --write test/smoke/dashboard-endpoints.test.ts` fixed the local formatter blocker before rerunning the checks.

**Recurrence update (2026-05-19):** While fixing Workspace terminal waiting status, focused `test/unit/dashboard-terminal-launch.test.ts` passed but targeted `npx prettier --check src/dashboard/views/workspace.html src/dashboard/dashboard-terminal.ts test/unit/dashboard-terminal-launch.test.ts` failed on the touched test file after adding longer source-regex assertions. Running the same touched-file set through `npx prettier --write ...` fixed the local formatter blocker before rerunning the focused terminal test.

**Recurrence update (2026-05-19):** While adding audit concern limit fields and terminal boundary tests, `npx prettier --check src/cli/audit/types.ts src/cli/server/types.ts src/cli/audit/audit.ts src/cli/audit/render.ts src/cli/prompt/compose-quality.ts src/dashboard/dashboard-setup-quality.ts src/dashboard/globals.d.ts src/dashboard/dashboard-readers.ts test/unit/audit-command.test.ts test/unit/quality-command.test.ts test/unit/preset-prompts.test.ts test/unit/dashboard-terminal-launch.test.ts test/unit/dashboard-home.test.ts` failed on the touched test files. Running the same touched-file set through `npx prettier --write ...` fixed the local formatter blocker before rerunning `npm run typecheck` and the targeted unit tests.

**Prevention:**
1. When preflight fails, immediately identify whether the failing files are in `git status` for the current task.
2. Treat repo-wide formatter failures in untouched files as residual baseline debt, not silent task fallout.
3. Keep the final verification section split between "checks that passed for this change" and "repo-wide checks still blocked by unrelated drift."

## Lesson: Temp-repo preflight harnesses inherit formatting debt from copied test files

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-19

**What happened:** The new M14 round-trip integration test cloned the repo into a tmpdir, patched the temp copy, and ran `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh`. Installer, parity, and drift logic were correct, but the first verification run still failed because the cloned `test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts` was not formatted, and preflight's formatter gate checks `test/**/*.ts`, not just the files patched inside the tmp repo after cloning.

**Root cause:** Treated the tmp repo like a narrow scratch fixture instead of a full repo clone. Formatting only the temp-mutated files under-approximated the real preflight surface, so the harness initially proved a weaker condition than the milestone claimed.

**Fix:** For tmp-repo preflight coverage, either keep the source test file formatted in the real checkout before cloning or explicitly format any copied `src/**/*.ts` and `test/**/*.ts` files that changed in the source repo. Assume preflight sees the entire cloned repo, not only the temp patch set.

**Prevention update (2026-04-20):**
1. Treat any unformatted tracked file in the real checkout as a blocker for `checkDrift` round-trip fixtures, because the temp repo inherits that formatting debt before its own assertions run.
2. After touching `src/**/*.ts` or `test/**/*.ts`, run the formatter before trusting installer/preflight round-trip tests as evidence about drift logic.

## Lesson: New server helper files still count as repo-wide formatting debt

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-20

**What happened:** Extracting setup-detection helpers out of `src/cli/server/dashboard.ts` passed `npm run typecheck` and the focused dashboard integration suite, but `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh` still failed. The real checkout had three unformatted server files (`src/cli/server/dashboard.ts`, `src/cli/server/setup-detect.ts`, `src/cli/server/dashboard-assets.ts`), so preflight's Prettier gate failed locally and the installer round-trip fixture failed too because it clones the current checkout before running temp-repo preflight.

**Root cause:** Treated the structural refactor like a code-only change and stopped at type/runtime verification. In this repo, formatting debt in the source checkout is not isolated: the round-trip fixture inherits it and replays the same formatter failure inside the temp clone.

**Fix:** Run Prettier on every touched `src/**/*.ts` file before trusting preflight or fixture-backed drift tests. Re-run the focused failing test (`test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts`) after formatting, not just the original happy-path suite.

**Prevention:**
1. After adding a new TypeScript helper file, treat `prettier --check` as part of the focused verification, not only the final repo-wide gate.
2. When preflight and the installer round-trip fixture fail together on formatting, fix the real checkout first; the temp fixture will usually heal with it.

**Prevention update (2026-04-20):**
1. This pattern recurred on the next dashboard-server split when `src/cli/server/dashboard-routes.ts` and the rewritten `dashboard.ts` were left unformatted. Treat any new `src/cli/server/*.ts` extraction as high-risk for this exact preflight + round-trip failure pair.

## Lesson: New tests need formatter gate before verification claims

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-25

**What happened:** Added `test/unit/preset-prompts.test.ts` for the M01 security preset contract and the focused test passed, but `npx prettier --check src/dashboard/preset-prompts.json test/unit/preset-prompts.test.ts` failed on the new file.

**Root cause:** I treated the focused behavioral test as the first verification result for a new test file without running the repo formatter gate first.

**Recurrence update (2026-05-17):** M11 SARIF added `src/cli/audit/sarif.ts`, `test/unit/audit-sarif.test.ts`, and a small CLI route edit. The focused SARIF tests passed first, but the next scoped formatter check failed on all three touched TypeScript files. Running `npx prettier --write src/cli/audit/sarif.ts src/cli/cli.ts test/unit/audit-sarif.test.ts` fixed the task-local formatter blocker before typecheck/full tests. Evidence anchors: `src/cli/audit/sarif.ts` (search: `buildAuditSarifLog`), `test/unit/audit-sarif.test.ts` (search: `routes audit --format sarif through the CLI renderer`).

**Prevention:** After adding or editing TypeScript tests, run `npx prettier --write <changed test files>` before claiming focused test verification. Keep the formatter check in the same verification bundle as the focused test so style failures are corrected before milestone boxes are ticked.

## Lesson: Slow installer round-trip catches prompt/test lint debt

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-26

**What happened:** After fixing quality-prompt and audit-provenance issues, `npm run test:slow` failed in `checkDrift: installer round-trip fixture` because the temp repo's preflight reported one ESLint error and one Prettier failure. The root causes were in the current working tree: `src/cli/prompt/compose-quality.ts` had an over-complex helper, and `test/unit/quality-command.test.ts` needed Prettier formatting. Direct `npx eslint src/cli src/dashboard` and `npm run format:check` reproduced both failures.

**Root cause:** I treated focused unit tests, typecheck, and fast-suite results as enough after changing a prompt helper and test fixture. The slow installer round-trip runs repo preflight inside a copied checkout, so it catches lint and format debt that focused tests do not.

**Prevention:** Before rerunning `npm run test:slow` after prompt/test changes, run `npx eslint src/cli src/dashboard` and `npm run format:check` locally. If the slow round-trip preflight fails, reproduce the reported gate directly in the source checkout before changing installer or drift logic.

## Lesson: Final verification gates need supported scopes and captured logs

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-05-19

**What happened:** During the M30-M34 closeout, I ran an ad hoc ESLint command that included ignored test files and a `.mjs` helper outside the TypeScript ESLint project, producing a tooling failure unrelated to the code change. The same final-gate bundle ran `npm test` in parallel with other expensive checks; it reported one failing test but the returned output did not include the failing block. A clean rerun with output captured to a temp log passed (`# tests 881`, `# pass 881`, `# fail 0`).

**Root cause:** I mixed repo-supported verification scopes with improvised paths and treated parallel final gates as interchangeable with a clean final evidence run. That made the first failure ambiguous and forced a rerun to recover the actual evidence.

**Recurrence update (2026-05-19):** The same closeout also added a dashboard markdown performance sanity test whose 500KB fixture was newline-heavy. Focused runs passed, but preflight's concurrent fast-suite runner exceeded the 100ms budget. The fixture still needed to be 500KB, but it needed to measure plain markdown throughput rather than line-break parsing stress.

**Recurrence update (2026-05-19):** M01 commit-guidance work added a new helper and tests. Focused `npx tsc --noEmit` and the new test file passed, but the first full preflight failed in the TypeScript gate: `Knip: 2 unused exports/types`. The exported names were internal helper types, not public API. Removing the unnecessary `export` keywords fixed `npx knip`. Evidence anchors: `src/cli/prompt/commit-guidance.ts` (search: `type CommitGuidanceStatus`), `test/unit/commit-guidance.test.ts` (search: `detects dominant conventional-commit history`).

**Prevention:** Use the repo's supported scopes for final gates (`npx eslint src/cli src/dashboard`, `npm run format:check`, `npx knip --no-progress`). Run full `npm test` alone or capture it to a log before starting parallel expensive checks. When Knip reports configuration hints after a dependency starts being used for real, remove the temporary ignore entry instead of carrying it forward. For performance sanity tests that run in the default fast suite, keep fixtures representative of the named budget and stable under test concurrency. Evidence anchors: `package.json` (search: `test:fast`), `test/unit/dashboard-markdown.test.ts` (search: `MarkdownIt`), `knip.json` (search: `ignoreDependencies`).

## Lesson: Format touched TypeScript tests before repo-wide preflight

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-30

**What happened:** While implementing quality-assessment follow-ups, focused tests and `npm run typecheck` passed, but the first `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh` run failed at Prettier with `2 unformatted files`. Running `npm run format` touched only the new/edited TypeScript test files, and the fresh preflight rerun passed.

**Root cause:** I treated focused tests plus typecheck as enough before the repo-wide gate even though new TypeScript test assertions had not been formatter-normalized. Preflight records formatter failure before later gates, so fixing format after a failed preflight requires a clean rerun to produce valid final evidence.

**Prevention:** After editing TypeScript tests or prompt/schema fixtures, run `npm run format` or `npm run format:check` before `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh`. If preflight fails at Prettier, format, inspect the diff, and rerun preflight from scratch before claiming the final gate. Evidence anchors: `test/unit/check-content-quality.test.ts` (search: `discovers current ADR files`), `test/unit/quality-schema.test.ts` (search: `evidence_warning_count`).

## Lesson: Untracked source-shadow files can poison lint, formatter, and drift gates together

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-20

**What happened:** A tiny Prompts view color tweak looked unrelated to the TypeScript gates, but the first verification rerun still failed preflight and the installer round-trip fixture. The real blocker was an untracked JavaScript shadow file sitting next to the canonical `src/cli/types.ts`. ESLint tried to parse the stray `.js` file against the TypeScript project config, Prettier treated it as a source file under `src/**/*.{ts,js,html}`, and the fixture cloned the same bad state into its temp repo.

**Root cause:** A generated or accidental source-shadow file under `src/` can evade attention because typecheck and the visible diff for the requested change point elsewhere. The repo gates scan the filesystem, not just tracked TS files, so an untracked sibling output can contaminate lint/format/drift verification far away from the user-visible edit.

**Fix:** Check `git status` and `git ls-files` when lint/prettier/fixture failures do not match the touched file. If the blocker is an untracked source-shadow file like `src/**/*.js` beside a canonical `src/**/*.ts`, delete it and rerun the exact failing gates.

**Prevention:**
1. When preflight suddenly fails with mixed ESLint + Prettier + drift-fixture errors after a small change, scan for untracked source-shadow files under `src/` before changing the requested code again.
2. Treat `src/**/*.js` siblings of tracked `src/**/*.ts` files as suspicious unless the repo intentionally tracks them.

## Lesson: Shared hook refactors need both hook-local proof and repo-wide preflight

**Created:** 2026-04-21

**What happened:** A `deny-dangerous.sh` hardening pass looked correct after the first edit, but the canonical self-test immediately failed because `BASH_REMATCH` was reused after a recursive `check_segment` call inside the new command-substitution helper. After fixing that, the hook copies all passed their own `--self-test`, yet full `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh` still failed because `scripts/deny-dangerous.sh` is linted under the stricter repo-wide `shellcheck scripts/*.sh` profile, which does not exclude `SC2016` the way the hook-directory check does. The installer round-trip fixture failed for the same reason because it clones the current checkout before running temp-repo preflight.

**Prevention:**
1. In Bash regex helpers, copy `BASH_REMATCH[n]` into local variables before any recursive call or nested regex operation that can overwrite it.
2. For shared hook templates, do not stop at `bash workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test`; also rerun the repo-wide `shellcheck scripts/*.sh scripts/maintenance/*.sh` and full `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh`, because `scripts/deny-dangerous.sh` and fixture clones exercise stricter paths than the hook directories.
