## Lesson: "Double check" means read the files, not re-run the tests

**Created:** 2026-03-22

**What happened:** User asked to "double check" multiple times. Each time, re-ran typecheck + tests + scan. Never caught stale shape references, documentation inconsistencies, or content quality issues that three external agents found immediately by reading the actual files.
**Root cause:** Interpreted verification as "run the pipeline" instead of "read what changed." Tests only cover what they test.
**Fix:** Added removed-pattern check to preflight. "Double check" should include: (1) run pipeline, (2) grep removed patterns, (3) read 3-5 changed files for content accuracy.

## Pattern: Verification scope must match change scope

**Created:** 2026-04-08

When the change is code-only, running tests is sufficient. When the change touches docs, setup prompts, or workflow templates, verification must read those files too. The verification scope must match the blast radius of the change. When building on existing files, audit them first - errors in source files propagate to everything built on top.

## Pattern: Agent skipped the AI testing gate and offered to continue to the next milestone

**Created:** 2026-03-31

**What happened:** After executing M1 (Fixes & Hygiene), the agent reported results and offered to "continue with P9/P17/P4" - moving to the next work item without running the AI Testing Gate that was literally in the same milestone file it had been working from. The gate was designed by the agent itself, written into the milestone file, and explicitly says "Run this prompt after all M1 tasks are complete." The agent wrote it, completed the tasks, and skipped it entirely.

**Why this matters:** The AI Testing Gate is the verification step that catches implementation errors before they propagate. Skipping it means the doer is also the judge - the exact anti-pattern the gate was designed to prevent. The agent's eagerness to move forward ("Want me to continue?") overrode the verification step that stood between finishing and done.

**This is the same root cause as the commit offer and the checkbox skip:** After completing implementation work, the agent's default is to report results and suggest the next action. Verification steps that happen AFTER the primary output get skipped because the agent treats "code works, tests pass" as the finish line.

**Prevention:** After completing all tasks in a milestone, the NEXT action is ALWAYS the AI Testing Gate - not reporting results, not suggesting next steps. The gate must run before any summary or status update. Treat the testing gate as the last task in the milestone, not a post-milestone activity.

## Pattern: Agent didn't tick checkbox tasks during execution

**Created:** 2026-03-31

**What happened:** CLAUDE.md VERIFY section says "If working from a plan/milestone file, MUST tick `- [x]` on each task as it's completed - not at the end." While executing M1 (17 tasks across 10 priority groups), the agent completed all tasks but ticked zero checkboxes. Only noticed when the user pointed it out. Same root cause as the commit offer - instructions read but not followed when a strong default behavior (finish the code, report results) took over.

**Prevention:** Before starting work from a milestone file, read the checkbox tasks. After each task completes, tick it immediately - before moving to the next task. "Not at the end" means not at the end.

---

## Lesson: RECURRENCE - Agent didn't tick checkboxes during M29 execution (same failure as M1)

**Created:** 2026-04-04

**What happened:** While executing M29 (Workflow Review Fixes - 6 workstreams, ~25 sub-tasks, ~100 checkboxes), the agent completed every task, ran full verification, marked the milestone "Done", wrote a session log - and ticked zero checkboxes. The user discovered it during review and escalated. This is a direct recurrence of the pattern documented on 2026-03-31 (M1 execution, same root cause).

**Why this is worse than the first time:**
1. The lesson was already documented 4 days ago in this exact file
2. CLAUDE.md VERIFY explicitly says "MUST tick `- [x]` on each task as it's completed - not at the end"
3. The agent had just EXPANDED the shared conventions block to include closing protocol instructions about checkpoint discipline
4. The agent was executing a plan about fixing verification and consistency failures - and committed the same verification failure in the process

**Root cause (unchanged):** When parallelizing work across multiple agents, the orchestrating agent tracks completion mentally but never writes it to the file. The "tick as you go" rule is read, understood, and ignored because the strong default is: launch agent → read result → launch next agent. The file update step has no forcing function.

**Previous prevention (insufficient):** "After each task completes, tick it immediately." This didn't work because "immediately" competes with "launch the next parallel agent" and loses.

**Stronger prevention:** After receiving results from EACH agent or completing EACH sub-task, the FIRST action must be editing the milestone file to tick the checkbox - BEFORE reading the next task, launching the next agent, or doing anything else. If parallelizing, tick all completed checkboxes in a batch BEFORE starting the next phase. Treat unticked checkboxes as uncommitted work - if the session dies, the progress is invisible.

---

## Lesson: RECURRENCE #3 - Agent didn't tick M32 checkboxes after completing M32a tasks
**Created:** 2026-04-05

**What happened:** Completed all 5 M32a merge-blocker tasks (reset endpoint, userRole fallback, path traversal, DNS rebinding, telemetry key). Verified with tsc + tests + preflight. Then moved on to answering the user's other questions without ticking any checkboxes in `M32-dashboard-polish.md`. User caught it. Third occurrence of the same pattern (M1 → M29 → M32).

**Why previous prevention failed:** The "stronger prevention" from M29 says "FIRST action must be editing the milestone file." But the user sent follow-up messages while I was working, and I context-switched to answering them instead of ticking checkboxes first. The forcing function ("before doing anything else") lost to "the user is waiting for a response."

**What needs to change:** This pattern has survived 3 rounds of "just do it harder" prevention rules. Documentation-level enforcement does not work. This needs mechanical enforcement - either a hook that checks for unticked items after tool calls, or a habit of ticking DURING the edit (in the same Edit call that makes the fix), not as a separate step after.

---

## Pattern: "AI gate passed" does not mean the work is done

**Created:** 2026-04-01

**What happened:** M1 AI gate said 14/14 checks passed. Real-world test on halaxy-agents-lab (2026-04-01) found: 12 goat skill dirs instead of 6 (stale skills not cleaned), router table with 12 entries instead of 6, missing Edit/Write .env deny (only Read installed), CI workflow checking for "goat-goat" instead of "goat", version headers still at 0.9.2, format hook referencing uninstalled formatters. The AI gate checked whether code EXISTS in the goat-flow repo, not whether it WORKS on real consumer projects.

**Root cause:** The AI verifier read goat-flow source code and confirmed features were implemented. It never ran setup on a real project to verify the output. The verifier tested the tool, not the tool's output. Same pattern as "Scanner 100% does not mean the project is correct."

**Prevention:** AI testing gates must include at least one end-to-end test: run the tool against a real project and verify the result. Checking source code is necessary but not sufficient.

---

## Pattern: End-of-task rules get skipped

**Created:** 2026-04-08

Rules that fire after the agent has delivered its primary output have near-zero compliance. The agent's attention is on the deliverable, not the closing checklist. Session logging, learning loop updates, and handoff notes all suffer from this. Prevention must be structural: either make the closing step part of the output format (so it happens DURING delivery, not after), or enforce it via hooks/DoD gates that block completion.

---

## Pattern: Blocked ≠ impossible

**Created:** 2026-04-08

Deny hooks block dangerous patterns, not all operations. When a command is blocked, spend 2 seconds thinking about the safe alternative before asking the user or giving up.

---

## Lesson: Formatter verification must preserve repo style flags

**Created:** 2026-04-03

**What happened:** While tightening scanner messages, verification included a `prettier --write` pass on three rubric files without the repo's single-quote flag. The code was still valid, but the formatter rewrote quote style across entire files and created a much larger diff than intended.
**Root cause:** Treated formatting as a neutral cleanup step instead of part of the blast radius. The command matched the tool, but not the repo's existing style contract.
**Fix:** When formatting targeted files during verification, use the same style flags the repo already uses or the same invocation pattern that previous maintenance/test scripts used. Always check `git diff --stat` immediately after formatter runs to catch accidental blast-radius expansion.

---

## Lesson: Workflow parser refactors need both fixture coverage and typecheck

**Created:** 2026-04-03

**What happened:** While tightening CI-validation checks, the first pass on the workflow `run:` parser read the wrong regex capture group and then used a router heuristic that only matched commands containing the word `router`. The focused regression suite and `tsc` both failed before the broader test run finished.
**Root cause:** Changed parsing and heuristics together without first validating the extracted command shape. The new regression covered the shell pattern, but the implementation still assumed the old capture layout and overfit to existing workflow wording.
**Fix:** For parser refactors, verify in this order: (1) print/exercise the extracted intermediate values, (2) run the focused regression suite, (3) run `npx tsc --noEmit`, then (4) run the full test suite. Heuristics should match behavior patterns like `grep ... | while read ... [ ! -e ]`, not just keywords in step names.

---

## Lesson: Rubric honesty changes need both in-memory and disk-backed fixture sync

**Created:** 2026-04-03

**What happened:** Tightened `2.2.2` so a registered stop hook only passes when it also runs real validation commands. The new focused regression passed immediately, but the disk-backed `failing-known` fixture still expected the old failure set and broke on the next verification step.
**Root cause:** Updated the rubric logic and the in-memory regression corpus first, but forgot that `test/fixtures/projects/failing-known/fixture.json` and `test/fixtures/project-fixtures.test.ts` also encode expected failing check IDs. Scanner honesty work touches more than one fixture layer.
**Fix:** Whenever a rubric check changes semantics, verify in this order: (1) focused in-memory regression, (2) disk-backed fixture corpus, (3) full suite. Search for the check ID in `test/fixtures/` before treating the change as complete.

---

## Lesson: New blocking checks can break passing fixtures even when the scanner is correct

**Created:** 2026-04-03

**What happened:** Added a new deny-hook check for pipe-to-shell blocking. The focused scanner regression passed, but the next full-suite run dropped both disk-backed `passing-minimal` and `passing-full` from `100` to `99`.
**Root cause:** The new rubric requirement was correct, but the "passing" fixture baseline still used settings-based deny rules that blocked `rm -rf`, force push, and `chmod 777` without also blocking `curl | bash` / `wget | sh`. Positive fixtures are just as sensitive to new honesty checks as failing fixtures.
**Fix:** When adding a new required check, audit both failure fixtures and passing baselines. For rubric changes, verify in this order: (1) focused regression, (2) disk-backed passing fixtures, (3) disk-backed failing fixtures, (4) full suite. If a positive fixture drops, update the fixture input first, not the expected score.

## Lesson: Heading regexes can silently truncate router-table checks

**Created:** 2026-04-03

**What happened:** Tightened `2.4.3` to parse the Router Table directly, but the first extractor used a multiline regex with `$` in the lookahead. In JavaScript regexes, `$` under `/m` matches end-of-line, so the match stopped after the `## Router Table` heading and never included the rows below it. The new regression also referenced an undefined fixture constant, so the first focused test run broke twice before the real logic was verified.
**Root cause:** Reached for a compact heading regex instead of reusing the repo’s line-based section parsing style, then wrote a regression that depended on a fixture helper that did not exist in that file.
**Fix:** For markdown section extraction, prefer line-based parsers over multiline heading regexes with `$`. For new regressions, build the smallest self-contained fixture possible unless the shared fixture object is already in scope.

---

## Lesson: Path normalization can invalidate later path-shape heuristics

**Created:** 2026-04-03

**What happened:** After normalizing router references by trimming trailing slashes, the follow-up `2.4.3` filter still looked for the literal substring `/skills/`. That turned `.claude/skills/` into `.claude/skills`, so the canonical passing fixture dropped from `100` to `99` even though the router row was correct.
**Root cause:** Mixed two phases of logic without rechecking the invariant after normalization. The filter assumed the original slash shape still existed after the normalizer had deliberately removed it.
**Fix:** When a parser normalizes paths, downstream checks must use shape tests that still hold after normalization, such as segment-boundary regexes (`/\/skills(?:\/|$)/`) instead of raw substring checks that depend on trailing separators.

## Lesson: Regressions caught too late - tests run at milestone granularity, not edit granularity

**Created:** 2026-04-05

**What happened:** Claude Insights reported 68 buggy-code friction events across 112 sessions (61% of sessions had at least one). The `/goat-test` skill generates test plans after implementation, and `stop-lint.sh` runs linting after every turn, but neither catches logic regressions mid-implementation. Tests only run when the user explicitly asks or when a milestone completes. Regressions introduced in turn 3 of a 10-turn implementation aren't caught until the end, when the debugging context is stale.

**Root cause:** The verification loop runs at the wrong granularity. Lint after every turn catches syntax. Tests after every milestone catch logic. The gap between these two is where regressions hide.

**Prevention:**
1. Consider an optional post-write hook that runs the project's test command after file changes (configured via `config.yaml`, off by default)
2. Skills with implementation phases should include a "run tests" checkpoint every N edits, not just at phase boundaries
3. For test-heavy projects (1000+ tests), a focused test subset (changed files only) avoids the full-suite penalty while still catching regressions early

---

## Lesson: Parallel sessions (37% of messages) need concurrency-safe file patterns

**Created:** 2026-04-05

**What happened:** Claude Insights showed 75 overlap events across 77 sessions - 37% of all messages happened during parallel Claude sessions. Learning loop files (`.goat-flow/logs/`, `.goat-flow/lessons/`, `.goat-flow/footguns/`) are append-only by convention, but nothing prevents two agents from writing to the same file simultaneously. Session logs use date-slug filenames which reduces collisions, but category bucket files (e.g. `.goat-flow/lessons/verification.md`) are shared write targets.

**Root cause:** goat-flow was designed for single-agent sessions. The category bucket format (multiple entries in one file) creates write contention that per-entry files (one file per lesson) wouldn't have.

**Prevention:**
1. Document which files are safe for concurrent access in the plugin instructions
2. For learning loop writes during parallel sessions, use unique filenames (date-agent-slug) rather than appending to shared buckets
3. Session logs already use unique filenames - extend this pattern to footgun/lesson entries when multi-agent mode is detected

## Lesson: Framework paths vs project paths in verbatim-installed skills

**Created:** 2026-04-11
**What happened:** M17a extracted skill modes into the repository template directory and left repository-local template references in the skill files. Skills are installed verbatim, so every project received instructions that pointed back into the goat-flow repo instead of the installed project. R9 scored system avg 42 (down from 53.7) largely because of this single bug.
**Evidence:** R9 critiques - 6 of 7 projects flagged broken template references. `workflow/skills/goat.md:71,74`, `workflow/skills/goat-security.md:71`, `workflow/skills/goat-test.md:108,145` all used repository-local template paths instead of installed-project template paths.
**Prevention:** After editing any skill file that references a path, verify the path exists from the PROJECT's perspective, not the goat-flow repo's perspective. Add to DoD: "grep skill files for repository-local template paths and replace them with the installed project-local equivalent before shipping."

## Lesson: Multi-agent critique finds findings single reviewers miss - but synthesis is the expensive part

**Created:** 2026-04-13

**What happened:** 9 independent agent reviews of goat-flow v1.1.0 found 25 confirmed defects. No single reviewer found all 25. The Codex compaction hook false positive (M1) was found by 1 of 9 reviewers. The ask_first glob-unaware false positive (M8) was found by 1 of 9 reviewers. Both are MAJOR audit honesty issues. The first review established ~60-70% of findings; each additional review added diminishing but non-zero value, including MAJOR findings in reviews 6 and 9.

**What this means for critique practice:**
1. Multi-agent critique is worth doing for large surfaces. A single thorough review will miss things, and the things it misses can be important.
2. Model diversity matters more than count. Codex scored 93/100 (most generous) because it systemically missed documentation surfaces. One Codex + one Gemini + one Claude covers more ground than three Claudes.
3. The synthesis + verification layer is where the value is captured. ~15-20% of claims across 9 reviews were wrong or needed active verification. Unverified multi-agent output is noisier, not more reliable.
4. Sweet spot: 4-5 reviews from different models for a framework/architecture audit. 3 for a feature or module.
5. Score convergence across reviewers is the signal that coverage is adequate - not review count. High score variance (74 vs 93 on the same codebase) means some reviewer missed a major category.

**Prevention:** When commissioning multi-agent critique, plan for synthesis work. Budget time to: (a) verify disputed claims against source code, (b) track first-discovery of each finding, (c) dispute false claims with evidence. The critique is an input that requires judgment, not a spec that gets executed.

## Lesson: Blindly applying review feedback without verifying findings

**Created:** 2026-04-11
**What happened:** After receiving 8 critic reviews of the goat-flow framework, the agent started fixing every cited `file:line` without first checking whether the findings were still valid. Several of the cited issues had already been fixed by sub-agents earlier in the same session. The agent was about to edit files that were already correct, potentially reintroducing bugs or making nonsensical changes.

**Root cause:** Treating review output as a task list instead of as claims to verify. The agent read "CLAUDE.md:11 still has 6-step loop" and jumped to editing without running `sed -n '11p' CLAUDE.md` first. Reviews are evidence-tagged opinions, not commands. The evidence can be stale by the time you read it - especially when multiple agents are editing the same repo in the same session.

**Prevention:**
1. Before acting on any review finding, verify the cited evidence is still current: read the actual file at the cited line
2. Batch-verify all findings first (`grep`, `sed -n`, `head`), then fix only what's actually broken
3. Reviews from agents that didn't run the latest code are particularly likely to cite stale evidence
4. "8 critics agree" does not mean "8 critics are right" - they may all be reading the same stale state

## Lesson: 14 self-dogfooding bugs survived 9 rounds of critique and 17 milestones

**Created:** 2026-04-11
**What happened:** After M17, 6 external critics independently reviewed the goat-flow framework itself (not installed projects). They found 14 verified bugs that had survived all prior milestones: foundation.ts emitting v1.0, SKILL_TEMPLATES missing goat-sbao, config.yaml referencing a renamed script, README overclaiming hooks, stale test fixtures encoding the wrong skill count, setup fragments still creating coding-standards (removed in M13), classify-state marking "healthy" from version alone, and more. Every bug was a 1-5 line fix.

**Why these were missed:**
1. **Tests validated shape, not truth.** Contract tests checked "does this section heading exist" not "is the skill count correct." `evaluate-check.test.ts:270` literally says "All 6 skills present" - nobody noticed when goat-sbao made it 7.
2. **Self-critique was pipeline-focused.** Every milestone ran `tsc`, `npm test`, `scan`, `preflight`. All passed. None caught that README said "Six" or that foundation.ts hardcoded v1.0. The pipeline tests what it tests; it doesn't read prose.
3. **No external review until R8+.** The first 7 rounds critiqued goat-flow as installed on OTHER projects. Nobody reviewed the goat-flow repo itself until round 8. Self-review is blind to self-consistency.
4. **Rename survivors.** `context-validate.sh` was renamed to `validate-goat-flow-setup.sh` but config.yaml kept the old name. `presets.js` was renamed to `preset-prompts.js` but architecture.md kept the old name. No grep-after-rename discipline for config/docs (only code).

**Prevention:**
1. Add contract tests that link canonical constants to docs: `SKILL_NAMES.length` must match README, docs, config, SKILL_TEMPLATES, and test fixtures
2. After any rename, grep ALL file types (not just `.ts` and `.md` - also `.yaml`, `.json`, `.sh`)
3. Periodically invite external review of the goat-flow repo itself, not just installed output
4. `preflight-checks.sh` should verify SKILL_NAMES count consistency across surfaces

---

## Lesson: Blindly applying critique recommendations without verifying claims

**Created:** 2026-04-14

**What happened:** A critique agent claimed `.goat-flow/architecture.md:18` had the wrong build-check breakdown: "says 7+9, actual code shows 12+4." The claim was accepted at face value and the doc was changed from "7 project setup + 9 per-agent" to "12 setup scope + 4 harness scope." A subsequent self-critique ran `BUILD_CHECKS` and confirmed the actual breakdown is **7 setup + 9 harness** — the original numbers were correct and the "fix" made the doc more wrong. The preflight's "Architecture doc counts match code" check only validates the total (16), not the sub-breakdown, so the error passed all automated gates.

**Root cause:** The first critique agent likely miscounted or read a stale build of the code. The claim was plausible (it got the total right), which made it easy to accept without running the verification command. The same session also changed `code-map.md` correctly for a different issue, creating a false sense that all claims were verified.

**Evidence:** `node --input-type=module -e "const b=await import('./dist/cli/audit/agent-setup-checks.js'); b.BUILD_CHECKS.forEach(c => console.log(c.scope, c.id))"` — outputs 7 setup + 9 harness.

**Prevention:**
1. Before changing any numeric claim in a canonical doc, run the verification command yourself — never trust a critique's count.
2. The preflight should validate sub-breakdowns, not just totals.
3. Treat external critique findings as hypotheses, not facts. Verify each one independently before applying.
