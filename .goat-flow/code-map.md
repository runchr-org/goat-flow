# Code Map

Quick orientation for agents working on the goat-flow codebase.

## src/cli/ -- TypeScript CLI auditor and dashboard

audit/
  audit.ts                 # Public audit command: build checks + optional harness completeness (--harness)
  check-goat-flow.ts       # 13 setup build checks (gate CI pass/fail)
  check-agent-setup.ts     # 4 agent build checks (gate CI pass/fail)
  harness/                 # 16 pass/fail completeness checks grouped by concern (5 files + helpers + index)

  types.ts                 # Audit-specific types (AuditReport, CheckResult, AuditFailure)

prompt/
  compose-setup.ts         # Generates audit-driven setup prompts for agents
