## Footgun: Audit does not prove end-to-end deny enforcement at runtime

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-05 | **Updated:** 2026-04-19 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

The audit validates hook syntax, self-test behavior, and registration, but does not prove that a blocked command actually fails with exit 2 under a real sub-agent invocation. A hook that passes every static check can still fail to block at runtime if registration or environment are wrong.

**Residual scope** (after 2026-04-18 `agent-deny-dangerous` check which invokes the hook's `--self-test` + covers quoted-alternation false positives):

1. Hook registration cross-check (file exists ↔ registered in settings). The `deny-hook-registered` check in `harness/check-constraints.ts` partially covers this but does not verify end-to-end that a blocked command actually fails with exit 2 under real invocation.
2. A dedicated `goat-flow verify` command for full runtime hook smoke-test is not yet built.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/audit/harness/check-constraints.ts` (search: `deny-hook-registered`) - cross-checks hook file existence against settings.json registration, but does not drive a blocked command through the live agent runtime.
- `src/cli/audit/check-agent-setup.ts` (search: `checkHookSelfTest`) - invokes the hook's `--self-test` so quoted-alternation false positives and pipe-to-shell bypass attempts are exercised, not just parsed. Does not verify end-to-end blocking through an actual sub-agent's Bash tool.

## Footgun: Audit howToFix emits commands the deny hook blocks

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** `check-agent-setup.ts` (search: `howToFix.*deprecated`) now emits text guidance ("Delete the SKILL.md inside each, then remove the empty directory") instead of shell commands. No longer triggers deny hook blocks.

**Original symptoms:** Running `goat-flow audit` and following its fix suggestions triggered deny-hook blocks because howToFix emitted `rm -rf ${path}` for deprecated skill directories.

## Footgun: Harness verifies post-turn hooks but not PreToolUse deny registration

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** `check-constraints.ts` (search: `deny-hook-registered`) now verifies PreToolUse/pre-tool deny hook registration via `af.hooks.denyIsRegistered`. Added in commit 708b1af. The `check-verification.ts` hooks-registered check correctly remains scoped to post-turn hooks only.

**Original symptoms:** A project could pass the harness audit without the deny hook being wired to PreToolUse.

## Footgun: Audit checks existed with no machine-readable justification

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-18 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** M05 defined the `CheckEvidence` schema and M11 back-filled it onto all 33 live audit checks. `BuildCheck` and `HarnessCheck` now require `provenance`, `runAudit()` validates every registered record via `validateProvenance()`, and per-check JSON output carries the full provenance object. CONTRIBUTING now requires new checks to ship provenance in the same change.

**Original symptoms:** The live registry had deterministic checks, but no per-check machine-readable record of why each one existed, which source justified it, or whether a rule was MUST/SHOULD/BEST_PRACTICE. Reviewers had to infer rationale from code, stale milestone text, or repo history.

## Footgun: Structural Compliance Illusion

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Build checks in `src/cli/audit/check-goat-flow.ts` and `src/cli/audit/check-agent-setup.ts` prove the install shape is present, not that the cold-path docs are semantically true. A structural PASS without content verification still creates false confidence.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/audit/check-goat-flow.ts` and `src/cli/audit/check-agent-setup.ts` gate file existence / install structure.
- `src/cli/audit/check-content-quality.ts` and `src/cli/audit/check-factual-claims.ts` exist because structural correctness alone did not catch cold-path truth drift.

**Prevention:** Keep structural audit and content-truth checks separate and explicit. Never treat a build PASS as proof that docs, ADRs, or prompts are semantically current.

## Resolved Entries

> Historical record. These entries are no longer active traps.

- **Scanner AP2 penalizes project-specific skills** (resolved 2026-04-01) - Removed AP2 check and `ap-fix-skill-names` fragment; scanner now only validates goat-flow's own skills.
- **Audit passes when configured agent's instruction file is missing** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Added `configured-agent-present` and `agent-artifacts-consistent` checks to cross-reference config.yaml against detected agents.
- **ask_first structural sync check generates false positives via glob-unaware comparison** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Added `normalizePath()` to strip glob suffixes before comparing config paths against instruction file content.
- **Scanner reports enforcement features it didn't detect** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Scanner removed in v1.1.0; hook facts now read from actual file content via `enrichDenyFromExecpolicy()`.
- **Scanner gives 100% while generated files are broken** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Scanner/rubric engine removed in v1.1.0; replaced with structural build checks plus pass/fail harness completeness checks.
- **Setup reports scanner metrics as audit results** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Scanner removed; `cli.ts` now calls `runAudit()` and reports actual hook file counts.
