## Footgun: Audit validates hook file content but not hook runtime behavior

**Status:** partially resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-05 | **Updated:** 2026-04-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

The audit checks that hook files exist and pass `bash -n` syntax check, but does not fully verify runtime behavior. A hook with correct syntax but wrong permissions, missing dependencies, or broken JSON field paths can still pass parts of the audit while providing degraded enforcement.

**Evidence:**
- 4+ sessions across 112 (Claude Insights data) derailed by sub-agent permission failures hitting hooks that the audit had already validated
- `deny-dangerous.sh` sed fallback still treats any `|` as a pipe and can false-positive on quoted regex alternation (e.g., `rg -n "foo|bar"` is blocked as pipe-to-shell) — observed this session.

**Partial resolution (2026-04-18):**
1. **Self-test now exists and runs.** `.claude/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh --self-test` covers 12 cases including 5 false-positive classes (read-only verbs containing dangerous string literals) and 2 bypass-attempt cases (redirect, pipe-to-shell). `check-agent-setup.ts` runs the self-test as part of the agent audit (search: `denyMechanismRuntime`).
2. **Self-test is run from the agent-setup check.** The `agent-deny-dangerous` check in `src/cli/audit/check-agent-setup.ts` invokes the self-test rather than relying on `bash -n` alone.

**Still open:**
1. Hook registration cross-check (file exists ↔ registered in settings). The `deny-hook-registered` check in `harness/check-constraints.ts` partially covers this but does not verify end-to-end that a blocked command actually fails with exit 2 under real invocation.
2. Quoted-regex false-positive class is not covered by the self-test; see hook false-positive entry above.
3. A dedicated `goat-flow verify` command for full runtime hook smoke-test is not yet built.

## Footgun: Audit howToFix emits commands the deny hook blocks

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** `check-agent-setup.ts` (search: `howToFix.*deprecated`) now emits text guidance ("Delete the SKILL.md inside each, then remove the empty directory") instead of shell commands. No longer triggers deny hook blocks.

**Original symptoms:** Running `goat-flow audit` and following its fix suggestions triggered deny-hook blocks because howToFix emitted `rm -rf ${path}` for deprecated skill directories.

## Footgun: Harness verifies post-turn hooks but not PreToolUse deny registration

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** `check-constraints.ts` (search: `deny-hook-registered`) now verifies PreToolUse/pre-tool deny hook registration via `af.hooks.denyIsRegistered`. Added in commit 708b1af. The `check-verification.ts` hooks-registered check correctly remains scoped to post-turn hooks only.

**Original symptoms:** A project could pass the harness audit without the deny hook being wired to PreToolUse.

## Footgun: Audit checks existed with no machine-readable justification

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-18 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** M05 defined the `CheckEvidence` schema and M11 back-filled it onto all 33 live audit checks. `BuildCheck` and `HarnessCheck` now require `provenance`, `runAudit()` validates every registered record via `validateProvenance()`, and per-check JSON output carries the full provenance object. CONTRIBUTING now requires new checks to ship provenance in the same change.

**Original symptoms:** The live registry had deterministic checks, but no per-check machine-readable record of why each one existed, which source justified it, or whether a rule was MUST/SHOULD/BEST_PRACTICE. Reviewers had to infer rationale from code, stale milestone text, or repo history.

## Resolved Entries

> Historical record. These entries are no longer active traps.

- **Scanner AP2 penalizes project-specific skills** (resolved 2026-04-01) - Removed AP2 check and `ap-fix-skill-names` fragment; scanner now only validates goat-flow's own skills.
- **Audit passes when configured agent's instruction file is missing** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Added `configured-agent-present` and `agent-artifacts-consistent` checks to cross-reference config.yaml against detected agents.
- **ask_first structural sync check generates false positives via glob-unaware comparison** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Added `normalizePath()` to strip glob suffixes before comparing config paths against instruction file content.
- **Scanner reports enforcement features it didn't detect** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Scanner removed in v1.1.0; hook facts now read from actual file content via `enrichDenyFromExecpolicy()`.
- **Scanner gives 100% while generated files are broken** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Scanner/rubric engine removed in v1.1.0; replaced with structural build checks plus pass/fail harness completeness checks.
- **Setup reports scanner metrics as audit results** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Scanner removed; `cli.ts` now calls `runAudit()` and reports actual hook file counts.

## Footgun: Structural Compliance Illusion

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Competitive analysis of 13 agent frameworks (including agnix and cclint) shows that agents frequently "game" the scanner by creating validly-structured but empty or hallucinated documentation files. A 100% structural pass does NOT mean the harness is effective. Without line-level content verification or automated cross-referencing, the auditor measures file existence rather than governance quality.

**Prevention:** Move toward line-level diagnostic precision (see agnix) and automated link verification (see cclint). Use M13's "Enforcement-in-code" pivot to bridge the gap between structure and signal.
