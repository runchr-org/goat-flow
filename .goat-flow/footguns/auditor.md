## Footgun: Audit does not prove end-to-end deny enforcement at runtime

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-05 | **Updated:** 2026-04-27 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

The audit validates hook syntax, self-test behavior, and registration, but does not prove that a blocked command actually fails with exit 2 under a real sub-agent invocation. A hook that passes every static check can still fail to block at runtime if registration or environment are wrong.

**Residual scope** (after 2026-04-18 `agent-deny-dangerous` check which invokes the hook's `--self-test` + covers quoted-alternation false positives):

1. Hook registration cross-check (file exists ↔ registered in settings). The `deny-hook-registered` check in `harness/check-constraints.ts` partially covers this but does not verify end-to-end that a blocked command actually fails with exit 2 under real invocation.
2. A dedicated `goat-flow verify` command for full runtime hook smoke-test is not yet built.
3. Static fact extraction can drift from the deny hook when hook regexes are generalized. On 2026-04-27, `detectBashDenyCoversSecrets` still expected older `/.ssh/` and `/.aws/` regex text after the hook moved to relative/home-root normalization, causing a false harness failure until the detector and unit coverage were updated.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/audit/harness/check-constraints.ts` (search: `deny-hook-registered`) - cross-checks hook file existence against settings.json registration, but does not drive a blocked command through the live agent runtime.
- `src/cli/audit/check-agent-setup.ts` (search: `checkHookSelfTest`) - invokes the hook's `--self-test` so quoted-alternation false positives and pipe-to-shell bypass attempts are exercised, not just parsed. Does not verify end-to-end blocking through an actual sub-agent's Bash tool.
- `src/cli/facts/agent/hooks.ts` (search: `detectBashDenyCoversSecrets`) - derives the harness secret-coverage fact from static markers in the hook file; it must stay aligned with `workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh` (search: `is_secret_path_touch`).
- `test/unit/audit-command.test.ts` (search: `detects current deny hook secret coverage from generalized path matcher`) - regression coverage for the static detector against the canonical hook template.

## Footgun: Structural Compliance Illusion

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Build checks in `src/cli/audit/check-goat-flow.ts` and `src/cli/audit/check-agent-setup.ts` prove the install shape is present, not that the cold-path docs are semantically true. A structural PASS without content verification still creates false confidence.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/audit/check-goat-flow.ts` and `src/cli/audit/check-agent-setup.ts` gate file existence / install structure.
- `src/cli/audit/check-content-quality.ts` and `src/cli/audit/check-factual-claims.ts` exist because structural correctness alone did not catch cold-path truth drift.

**Prevention:** Keep structural audit and content-truth checks separate and explicit. Never treat a build PASS as proof that docs, ADRs, or prompts are semantically current.

## Footgun: Quality prompt generation pays full per-agent audit cost on every load

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-29 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

The dashboard quality page can feel slow even when quality-history loading and prompt composition are effectively free. The hot path is the live per-agent harness audit that runs before the prompt is composed.

**Why it happens:** `handleQualityRequest` always calls `runAudit(fs, projectPath, { agentFilter: agent, harness: true })` before reading prior quality history or composing the prompt. In the real bash-enabled dashboard path, current-session timings measured fresh `/api/quality` requests at about 30,573 ms and 30,182 ms, with a cached repeat at about 5 ms after a short-lived per-agent cache was added. That means the new cache fixes repeat loads, but the first quality-page load still pays the full deny-hook/runtime evidence cost. Unlike the Home summary route, the quality route intentionally keeps full deny-hook/runtime evidence instead of downgrading to presence-only checks.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/server/dashboard-routes.ts` (search: `handleQualityRequest`) - runs `runAudit(fs, projectPath, { agentFilter: agent, harness: true })` before `findLatestQualityReport(...)` and `composeQuality(...)`.
- `src/dashboard/dashboard-setup-quality.ts` (search: `/api/quality?path=`) - entering the quality view or changing agent/mode always fetches `/api/quality`.
- `src/cli/server/dashboard-routes.ts` (search: `readQualityAuditCache(projectPath, agent, fresh)`) - repeat requests can reuse the short-lived per-agent audit cache, but only after one fresh audit has already completed.
- `src/cli/server/dashboard-routes.ts` (search: `denyMechanismEvidenceLevel: "present-only"`) - the summary-only evidence downgrade exists on `/api/audit`, not on `/api/quality`.

**Prevention:**
1. Profile `/api/quality` before touching history parsing or prompt rendering; those are easy suspects and were not the bottleneck here.
2. Treat route-level caching as a repeat-load improvement, not a first-load fix. If faster initial paint matters more than live audit grounding, split the route into cheap cached context plus an explicit "refresh full audit evidence" action.
3. If the full audit contract must stay on page load, optimize the underlying hook self-test itself; the cache cannot remove the first-run cost.

## Footgun: Audit howToFix emits commands the deny hook blocks

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** `check-agent-setup.ts` (search: `howToFix.*deprecated`) now emits text guidance ("Delete the SKILL.md inside each, then remove the empty directory") instead of shell commands. No longer triggers deny hook blocks.

**Original symptoms:** Running `goat-flow audit` and following its fix suggestions triggered deny-hook blocks because howToFix emitted `rm -rf ${path}` for deprecated skill directories.

## Footgun: Harness verifies post-turn hooks but not PreToolUse deny registration

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** `check-constraints.ts` (search: `deny-hook-registered`) now verifies PreToolUse/pre-tool deny hook registration via `af.hooks.denyIsRegistered`. Added in commit 708b1af. The `check-verification.ts` hooks-registered check correctly remains scoped to post-turn hooks only.

**Original symptoms:** A project could pass the harness audit without the deny hook being wired to PreToolUse.

## Footgun: Audit checks existed with no machine-readable justification

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-18 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** M05 defined the `CheckEvidence` schema and M11 back-filled it onto all 33 live audit checks. `BuildCheck` and `HarnessCheck` now require `provenance`, `runAudit()` validates every registered record via `validateProvenance()`, and per-check JSON output carries the full provenance object. CONTRIBUTING now requires new checks to ship provenance in the same change.

**Original symptoms:** The live registry had deterministic checks, but no per-check machine-readable record of why each one existed, which source justified it, or whether a rule was MUST/SHOULD/BEST_PRACTICE. Reviewers had to infer rationale from code, stale milestone text, or repo history.

## Footgun: Preflight node-to-grep pipeline passes unsanitized stdout into regex patterns

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-21 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-21 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** Node output piped through `grep -oE '^[0-9]+$' | tail -1` to extract only numeric lines. Architecture doc matching switched from `grep -q` (BRE) to `grep -Fq` (fixed strings). `setup_count` initialized before the conditional block to prevent `set -u` crash. Commit on `dev` branch, `scripts/preflight-checks.sh` (search: `grep -oE '^[0-9]+$'`).

**Original symptoms:** `npm publish` failed: the round-trip fixture test (`test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts`, search: `installs fixture-backed references`) intermittently crashed with `grep: Unmatched [, [^, [:, [., or [=` in the Doc/Code Drift section. Root cause: `node --input-type=module` commands that compute check counts (`build_count`, `quality_count`, `setup_count`, `agent_count`) captured raw stdout including stray node diagnostic lines containing `[` characters. These were then interpolated into `grep -q "${build_count} build"` where grep interpreted `[` as a regex character class. The first fix (output sanitization) introduced a second failure: when the sanitized pipeline returned empty in the temp fixture (node imports fail without a working `dist/`), `setup_count` was never set because it was assigned inside the `if [[ -n "$build_count" ]]` block but referenced unconditionally on line 526 - crashing with `set -u` (`unbound variable`).
