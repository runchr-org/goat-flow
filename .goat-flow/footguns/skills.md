## Footgun: Workflow-summarising skill descriptions cause CSO shortcutting

**Status:** active (rule is permanent; all current goat-* skills compliant as of 2026-04-18) | **Created:** 2026-04-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** Agents invoking a skill via `/<skill>` shortcut past the full `SKILL.md` body when the `description:` field summarises WHAT the skill does or HOW it works — the description becomes a substitute for reading the body.

**Why it happens:** LLMs anchor on the description as a sufficient summary and skip expanding the full skill content. This is the Claude Search Optimization (CSO) failure class.

**Evidence:**
- Original incident at `superpowers-skills/skills/meta/writing-skills/SKILL.md:134-172` — `subagent-driven-development`'s description said "dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks" and Claude performed ONE review instead of the two-stage review defined in the body.
- Regression caught in goat-flow itself on 2026-04-18: the `goat` dispatcher description was "Single entry point that classifies intent and dispatches to the correct goat-* skill" — workflow-summary, not trigger-only. Rewritten to "Use when you describe an outcome and need the right goat-* workflow chosen for you."

**Prevention:** Descriptions must be trigger-only — say WHEN to invoke the skill, never WHAT it does or HOW. All 7 current goat-* descriptions (including the dispatcher) are compliant as of 2026-04-18. When adding or editing a skill, the description field must pass the trigger-only test: if removing it and reading only the description tells you the skill's workflow steps or internal phases, it is a CSO violation regardless of how accurate it is.

## Footgun: Installed skill copies can drift on punctuation-only edits and fail unrelated test runs

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-18 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Original symptoms:** `npm test` failed in `test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts` even when the code change did not touch skills, because the tracked installed copies under `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` had Unicode em dashes while `workflow/skills/` templates had ASCII hyphens.

**Original evidence:**
- `workflow/skills/goat-plan/SKILL.md:15` vs `.claude/skills/goat-plan/SKILL.md:15` (hyphen vs em dash)
- `workflow/skills/goat-plan/SKILL.md:39` vs `.claude/skills/goat-plan/SKILL.md:39` (hyphen vs em dash)

**Resolution:** Installed copies are now byte-identical with the workflow templates on the cited lines (verified by `diff` returning empty output against both `.claude/skills/goat-plan/SKILL.md:15` and `:39`). The drift check at `test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts` now passes on these files.

**Prevention (retained):** When editing `workflow/skills/*/SKILL.md`, update the installed copies in `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` in the same change. The preflight `Skill SKILL.md Parity` check and `goat-flow audit --check-drift` both catch byte-level divergence before unrelated work is blocked by stale fixtures.

## Footgun: Release-version bumps can break skill-rename work through stale fixtures and hardcoded current-version routing

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A skill rename can look complete on directory, manifest, and docs surfaces but still fail verification because release-coupled helpers lag the version bump. On 2026-04-18, the M07 rename run first failed `npm test` in `test/integration/audit-build.test.ts` because the shared config stub still encoded the previous release version. After fixing that, the same verification pass exposed a second break: setup routing still hardcoded `1.1.x` as the only current branch, so a healthy `1.2.0` project was misclassified as needing an upgrade.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/audit/check-goat-flow.ts:272-289` enforces exact equality between `.goat-flow/config.yaml` and `AUDIT_VERSION`.
- `test/fixtures/projects/index.ts:34-48` is the shared `stubConfig()` used by audit-build fixtures; if it drifts from `AUDIT_VERSION`, "healthy project" tests fail for the wrong reason.
- `src/cli/classify-state.ts:41,145-180` derives the current version family and routes current vs outdated installs; hardcoding a previous family breaks `composeSetup()` as soon as the package version advances.
- `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh:72-81` must derive the install version from `package.json`; a hardcoded fallback recreates the same stale-version trap at install time.

**Prevention:** When a skill rename ships with a version bump, treat version-sensitive helpers as part of the rename surface. Update current-version classifiers, shared config fixtures, install-script version discovery, and setup-routing tests in the same change before trusting `npm test`.

## Footgun: Workflow template source and installed copy can silently diverge

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-15 | **Updated:** 2026-04-17 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** Agents on consumer projects follow a different rule than agents on the goat-flow repo, because the workflow template (install source) says one thing and the installed copy says another. The divergence is invisible - both files exist, both parse correctly, and no automated check compares their content.

**Resolution:** Four preventions implemented:
1. Divergence fixed - both files now match (verified by diff).
2. Preflight preamble/conventions check (search: `Preamble/Conventions Sync` in `scripts/preflight-checks.sh`) - byte-exact diff of preamble and conventions against workflow templates, fails if they differ.
3. Preflight skill parity check (search: `Skill SKILL.md Parity` in `scripts/preflight-checks.sh`) - byte-exact diff of each workflow template vs `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` installed copies.
4. CLI drift check (M04, 2026-04-17) via `goat-flow audit --check-drift` (search: `skillContentsEquivalent` in `src/cli/audit/check-drift.ts`) - YAML-aware normalisation so frontmatter key reorder and trailing whitespace do not false-positive; also detects orphan directories and deprecated skill names from `workflow/manifest.json:stale_names`.
5. Integration tests: `test/integration/preamble-sync.test.ts` covers shared docs; `test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts` covers the CLI path with tmpdir fixtures.

**Original evidence (historical):** The shared preamble (template at `workflow/skills/reference/skill-preamble.md`, installed at `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md`) diverged between template and installed copy around a single-line change; discovered 2026-04-15 by multi-agent critique. Exact line numbers from that incident are no longer recorded here because the file has been edited since.

## Footgun: Agent rewrites shared docs with agent-specific vocabulary

**Status:** resolved (behavioral pattern) | **Created:** 2026-03-21 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Moved to resolved: all evidence is from retired v1.1.0 files and current shared docs were verified multi-agent as of 2026-04-15. The behavioral pattern (agents replacing rather than adding) is documented as a lesson, not a current architectural trap. If the pattern recurs in current files, re-activate with fresh evidence.

**Prevention (retained):**
- Agent-specific files (`workflow/setup/agents/`, `.claude/`, `.gemini/`) - edits fine
- Shared docs (`docs/`, `workflow/`) - MUST remain agent-neutral or list all agents
- When adding agent support: ADD to tables and examples, never DELETE or REPLACE existing agent references
- Setup prompts MUST include explicit scope constraints: "Do NOT modify files outside `.gemini/` and `GEMINI.md`"

## Footgun: mv/cp/Write overwrites existing files without checking

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-03-21 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A file that existed at the destination path is silently overwritten and its content is permanently lost. Especially dangerous for untracked files that have no git recovery path.

**Why it happens:** `mv src dest` and `cp src dest` overwrite `dest` without warning if it already exists. The Write tool does the same. Agents treat rename/move as a single command without checking the destination. If the user then asks to "undo", the agent moves the overwritten content back to the source path - destroying the original destination content entirely.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/roadmaps/TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` → overwritten by `mv TODO_improvements_v0.3.md TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` (2026-03-21). The file was untracked and unrecoverable through git.

**Prevention:**
- Before ANY `mv`, `cp`, or Write to an existing path: run `ls` on the destination first
- If the destination exists, STOP and ask the user before proceeding
- For `mv`: use `mv -n` (no-clobber) instead of bare `mv`
- This is a Never-tier rule - overwriting a file the user didn't ask to overwrite is data destruction

## Footgun: Skills have phase gates but no time/call budget for context gathering

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-05 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-15 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Skills enforce phase gates (Step 0 must complete before Phase 1, gates pause for human approval) but have no budget for how long Step 0 can take. Claude can spend an entire session reading templates, exploring the codebase, and gathering context without ever producing output or asking a question.

**Resolution:** Both preventions implemented in `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md:77-79`:
1. Step 0 budget: "If Step 0 exceeds 5 file reads without producing output or asking a question, stop and present what you know so far."
2. Mid-Step-0 checkpointing: "Checkpoint mid-Step-0 for complex projects rather than silently reading indefinitely."

**Original evidence (historical):** Claude Insights (112 sessions) showed agents reading 20+ files in Step 0 without checkpointing, requiring user intervention to interrupt.

## Resolved Entries

> Historical record. These entries are no longer active traps.

- **Dispatcher intent mapping has no coverage for analysis/evaluation verbs** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Added analysis/evaluation verbs to the dispatcher disambiguation table so ambiguous requests prompt skill selection instead of auto-routing.
- **CI template derives skill names by prefixing instead of listing them** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Removed `src/cli/prompt/fragments/` directory in v1.1.0; CI template generation no longer exists.
