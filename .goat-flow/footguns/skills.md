## Footgun: Workflow template source and installed copy can silently diverge

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-15 | **Updated:** 2026-04-17 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** Agents on consumer projects follow a different rule than agents on the goat-flow repo, because the workflow template (install source) says one thing and the installed copy says another. The divergence is invisible - both files exist, both parse correctly, and no automated check compares their content.

**Resolution:** Four preventions implemented:
1. Divergence fixed - both files now match (verified by diff).
2. Preflight preamble/conventions check (search: `Preamble/Conventions Sync` in `scripts/preflight-checks.sh`) - byte-exact diff of preamble and conventions against workflow templates, fails if they differ.
3. Preflight skill parity check (search: `Skill SKILL.md Parity` in `scripts/preflight-checks.sh`) - byte-exact diff of each workflow template vs `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` installed copies.
4. CLI drift check (M04, 2026-04-17) via `goat-flow audit --check-drift` (search: `skillContentsEquivalent` in `src/cli/audit/check-drift.ts`) - YAML-aware normalisation so frontmatter key reorder and trailing whitespace do not false-positive; also detects orphan directories and deprecated skill names from `workflow/manifest.json:stale_names`.
5. Integration tests: `test/integration/preamble-sync.test.ts` covers shared docs; `test/integration/audit-drift.test.ts` covers the CLI path with tmpdir fixtures.

**Original evidence (historical):** `skill-preamble.md:10` diverged between template and installed copy, discovered 2026-04-15 by multi-agent critique.

## Footgun: Agent rewrites shared docs with agent-specific vocabulary

**Status:** resolved (behavioral pattern) | **Created:** 2026-03-21 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Moved to resolved: all evidence is from retired v1.1.0 files and current shared docs were verified multi-agent as of 2026-04-15. The behavioral pattern (agents replacing rather than adding) is documented as a lesson, not a current architectural trap. If the pattern recurs in current files, re-activate with fresh evidence.

**Prevention (retained):**
- Agent-specific files (`workflow/setup/agents/`, `.claude/`, `.gemini/`) - edits fine
- Shared docs (`docs/`, `workflow/`) - MUST remain agent-neutral or list all agents
- When adding agent support: ADD to tables and examples, never DELETE or REPLACE existing agent references
- Setup prompts MUST include explicit scope constraints: "Do NOT modify files outside `.gemini/` and `GEMINI.md`"

## Footgun: mv/cp/Write overwrites existing files without checking

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-03-21 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A file that existed at the destination path is silently overwritten and its content is permanently lost. Especially dangerous for untracked files that have no git recovery path.

**Why it happens:** `mv src dest` and `cp src dest` overwrite `dest` without warning if it already exists. The Write tool does the same. Agents treat rename/move as a single command without checking the destination. If the user then asks to "undo", the agent moves the overwritten content back to the source path - destroying the original destination content entirely.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/roadmaps/TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` → overwritten by `mv TODO_improvements_v0.3.md TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` (2026-03-21). The file was untracked and unrecoverable through git.

**Prevention:**
- Before ANY `mv`, `cp`, or Write to an existing path: run `ls` on the destination first
- If the destination exists, STOP and ask the user before proceeding
- For `mv`: use `mv -n` (no-clobber) instead of bare `mv`
- This is a Never-tier rule - overwriting a file the user didn't ask to overwrite is data destruction

## Footgun: Skills have phase gates but no time/call budget for context gathering

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-05 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-15 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Skills enforce phase gates (Step 0 must complete before Phase 1, gates pause for human approval) but have no budget for how long Step 0 can take. Claude can spend an entire session reading templates, exploring the codebase, and gathering context without ever producing output or asking a question.

**Resolution:** Both preventions implemented in `.goat-flow/skill-preamble.md:77-79`:
1. Step 0 budget: "If Step 0 exceeds 5 file reads without producing output or asking a question, stop and present what you know so far."
2. Mid-Step-0 checkpointing: "Checkpoint mid-Step-0 for complex projects rather than silently reading indefinitely."

**Original evidence (historical):** Claude Insights (112 sessions) showed agents reading 20+ files in Step 0 without checkpointing, requiring user intervention to interrupt.

## Resolved Entries

> Historical record. These entries are no longer active traps.

- **Dispatcher intent mapping has no coverage for analysis/evaluation verbs** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Added analysis/evaluation verbs to the dispatcher disambiguation table so ambiguous requests prompt skill selection instead of auto-routing.
- **CI template derives skill names by prefixing instead of listing them** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Removed `src/cli/prompt/fragments/` directory in v1.1.0; CI template generation no longer exists.
