## Footgun: Quality reviews disappear when the agent skips the final JSON write

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-19 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A quality review ran end-to-end, but `goat-flow quality history` reports no saved runs and `goat-flow quality diff` has nothing to compare. No file appears under `.goat-flow/logs/quality/`.

**Why it happens:** `goat-flow quality . --agent <id>` composes a prompt that instructs the agent to write its final JSON report directly to `.goat-flow/logs/quality/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>-<agent>-<rand5>.json`. The write is the agent's responsibility, not the CLI's. If the agent emits the JSON inline as a fenced code block, or forgets the save step, or writes to a different path, nothing persists. The target directory is gitignored, so there is no git-side hint that the save was skipped.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/prompt/compose-quality.ts` (search: `Write it as a file to`) — the prompt ends with an explicit instruction to write the file rather than emit a fenced JSON block.
- `src/cli/prompt/compose-quality.ts` (search: `Wrote quality report to`) — the prompt requires a single-line confirmation that references the saved filename.
- `src/cli/quality/history.ts` (search: `No saved quality history`) — `history` and `diff` only read files that were actually written to disk.

**Prevention:**
1. After any `/quality` run, verify the save landed: `ls .goat-flow/logs/quality/*.json | tail -3`. If the latest mtime is older than the review you just ran, the agent skipped the write.
2. If the agent replied with a fenced JSON block instead of writing a file, ask it to save the block to the expected path using its filesystem tool before closing the session.
3. Only after the file exists on disk is `quality history` / `quality diff` meaningful — both silently return empty when nothing is saved, so a missing save looks identical to "no prior runs."

See `.goat-flow/lessons/design-decisions.md` (2026-04-19 amendment under "Don't carve I/O side-effect exceptions into prompts that forbid I/O") for the historical thread that led here.
