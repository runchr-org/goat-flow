## Footgun: Cross-reference fragility across docs

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-03-18 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A renamed or moved file breaks links in multiple documents. Users following getting-started.md hit dead references.

**Why it happens:** Documentation files reference each other by relative path. The project has 120+ markdown files with dense cross-referencing. Renaming one file can break references in 5-10 others.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/getting-started.md` → referenced stale paths to old workflow directory (file retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/setup/`)
- `docs/five-layers.md` → referenced `FIVE_LAYER_SYSTEM.md` (old filename) (file retired in v1.1.0, see `workflow/setup/01-system-overview.md`)

~~**Evidence (historical - resolved):**~~
- ~~`.goat-flow/glossary.md:19` → still pointed at removed `workflow/setup/09-customise-to-project.md` after the M13 Phase 3 setup-step renumber~~ (resolved: now points to `workflow/setup/05-customise-to-project.md`)
- ~~`.goat-flow/decisions/ADR-009-evidence-lifecycle-convention.md:18` → still pointed at removed `workflow/setup/09-customise-to-project.md` after the same renumber~~ (resolved: now points to `workflow/setup/05-customise-to-project.md`)
- ~~`.goat-flow/decisions/ADR-033-sbao-mob-core-features.md:18` → still referenced removed `05-install-skills.md` after the setup flow moved the install step to `workflow/setup/03-install-skills.md`~~ (resolved: now points to `workflow/setup/03-install-skills.md`)

**Prevention:** After any file rename or move, grep the entire repo for the old path. Use `grep -r "old-filename" --include="*.md"` before declaring done. This is DoD gate #6.

## Footgun: Preflight validates doc totals but not sub-breakdowns

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-14 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A doc claim like "16 build checks (12 setup + 4 harness)" passes the preflight because the total (16) is correct, even though the breakdown (12+4) could be wrong. The sub-breakdown can be changed to any pair that sums to 16 and no automated check catches it.

**Why it happens:** `scripts/preflight-checks.sh` Doc/Code Drift section greps for `${build_count} build` in `.goat-flow/architecture.md` - a total-only check. There is no extraction or validation of the `(N scope + M scope)` parenthetical. This means the most useful part of the claim (the breakdown) is the least validated.

**Evidence:**
- `scripts/preflight-checks.sh` (search: `build_count.*build.*architecture`) - `grep -q "${build_count} build" .goat-flow/architecture.md` validates total only
- `.goat-flow/architecture.md:18` - was changed from "7+9" to "12+4" on 2026-04-14. Preflight passed because the total (16) was still correct. Current verified breakdown is 12 setup + 4 agent (via `SETUP_CHECKS.length` and `AGENT_CHECKS.length`).

**Prevention:** Add sub-breakdown validation: extract the `(N setup + M agent)` claim and validate N and M against `SETUP_CHECKS.length` and `AGENT_CHECKS.length`.

## Footgun: Cold-path docs drift while structural audit passes

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** The CLI audit reports PASS while cold-path documentation contains false claims, wrong check descriptions, dead paths, and glossary misdirections. Contributors reading docs instead of code form incorrect mental models of what the system does.

**Why it happens:** The audit validates structure (files exist, paths resolve, versions match) but not content accuracy. Cold-path docs are updated manually and drift as code changes. No automated check compares doc descriptions against actual code behavior.

**Evidence (verified by 8 independent critiques, 2026-04-15; recurrence confirmed by 4-critique cross-review, 2026-04-16):**

*Round 1 (2026-04-15, all resolved):*
- ~~`docs/audit-and-critique.md:38-47` - describes checks that no longer exist~~ (resolved 2026-04-15: check descriptions updated to match current code)
- ~~`docs/coding-standards/conventions.md:10` - claims "Zero runtime dependencies"~~ (resolved 2026-04-15: now says "Runtime dependencies: js-yaml, ws")
- ~~`docs/coding-standards/conventions.md:74` - claims `src/cli/prompt/types.ts` exists~~ (resolved 2026-04-15: reference removed)
- ~~`.goat-flow/glossary.md:21` - Handoff entry says "See Task Tracking in `.goat-flow/skill-preamble.md`"~~ (resolved 2026-04-16: glossary now correctly points to `skill-conventions.md`)
- ~~`.goat-flow/glossary.md:38` - Working Memory points to `skill-preamble.md`~~ (resolved 2026-04-16: glossary now correctly points to `skill-conventions.md`)
- ~~`.goat-flow/code-map.md:71` - lists `validate-goat-flow-setup.sh` under `scripts/`~~ (resolved 2026-04-16: code-map now lists it under `workflow/` with explanatory note)
- ~~`src/cli/prompt/compose-critique.ts:243` - ships literal placeholder `<your-hooks-dir>`~~ (resolved 2026-04-16: placeholder removed)

*Round 2 (2026-04-16, all resolved — same pattern recurred after dashboard TS migration and skill directory restructure):*
- ~~`CONTRIBUTING.md:60-61` - claimed "8 build checks" and "18 advisory checks"; actual: 16 and 16~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)
- ~~`CONTRIBUTING.md:41` - referenced `app.js` and `preset-prompts.js` after .ts rename~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)
- ~~`.goat-flow/code-map.md:27` - claimed 15 harness checks; actual: 16~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)
- ~~`.goat-flow/code-map.md:54-60` - showed flat skill file structure after directory restructure~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)
- ~~`.goat-flow/architecture.md:49` - referenced `preset-prompts.js` after .ts rename~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)
- ~~`src/cli/cli.ts:49` - help text said 15 harness checks; actual: 16~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)
- ~~`workflow/setup/03-install-skills.md:11` - referenced old flat skill file names~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)
- ~~`workflow/setup/upgrade-from-0.9.x.md:104` - referenced `goat-debug.md` instead of `goat-debug/SKILL.md`~~ (resolved 2026-04-16)

**Impact:** The framework demands "real evidence only" and "MUST maintain cross-file consistency" while its own cold-path surfaces violate both rules. Agents consulting docs for orientation get wrong information. The audit's PASS stamp creates false confidence.

**Prevention:**
1. Add content-drift checks to preflight: compare doc check descriptions against exported check names from code
2. Extend path-integrity checks to cover code-map, glossary canonical-file paths, and convention claims
3. Consider auto-generating audit docs from check code to prevent drift permanently
4. Change Step 01 early-stop rule (`workflow/setup/01-system-overview.md:12`) to require content-drift checks, not just structural audit pass

## Resolved Entries

> Historical record. These entries are no longer active traps.

- **Concept duplication across core docs** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Retired 4 conflicting doc files in v1.1.0; `workflow/setup/reference/execution-loop.md` is now the single authoritative source.
- **Product surface count drift across code, docs, config, and tests** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Fixed 14 inconsistencies where skill counts diverged across README, docs, config, templates, and tests after goat-sbao extraction.
- **Skill template paths use framework-local paths instead of project-local paths** (resolved 2026-04-12) - Changed skill template references from `workflow/templates/` to `.goat-flow/templates/` so paths resolve on consumer projects.
- **Refactor cleanup doesn't reach bash script conditional guards** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Removed dead `[[ -f src/cli/rubric/version.ts ]]` guard that silently skipped 74 lines of version-consistency checks.
- **Partial feature removal leaves type and detection artifacts** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Removed Copilot from type unions, UI name mappers, terminal runner maps, and SKILL_ROOTS after agent removal.
- **Line target inconsistency for project shapes** (resolved 2026-03-18) - Line target canonicalized to 120 for all shapes in ADR-029.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md directs contributors to the wrong subsystem** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Rewritten to describe build checks in `check-goat-flow.ts` + `check-agent-setup.ts` and quality checks in `src/cli/audit/harness/`.
- **Stale references from old project structure** (resolved 2026-04-15) - `ai-workflow-framework` no longer appears anywhere in the repo (verified by `rg "ai-workflow-framework"`).
