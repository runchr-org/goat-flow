## Footgun: Setup creates parallel surfaces instead of migrating existing ones

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-04-03 | **Updated:** 2026-04-19 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

When a project already has learning-loop artifacts at legacy paths, the installer creates NEW `.goat-flow/*` surfaces alongside them instead of detecting and migrating the existing ones:

- `tasks/` AND `.goat-flow/tasks/` both end up present
- `docs/footguns.md` (flat) AND `.goat-flow/footguns/` (directory) both end up present
- `docs/lessons.md` AND `.goat-flow/lessons/` both end up present

**Evidence:**
- `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh` (search: `# 0. Legacy surface detection`) now performs non-blocking detection and warns on `docs/footguns.md`, `docs/lessons.md`, `docs/lessons/`, and stale skill dirs before creating the `.goat-flow/*` tree. Detection landed 2026-04-18; auto-migration is still out of scope.
- Found by Codex on consumer projects: ambient-scribe (4 duplicate surfaces), blundergoat-platform (context-validate.sh required BOTH old and new at the time), healthkit (contradictory paths in CLAUDE.md vs config.yaml vs skills).
- `.goat-flow/coding-standards/` was historically part of this pattern in v0.9 installs. v1.1.0 removed `coding-standards` as a first-class surface (see `workflow/setup/05-customise-to-project.md` and `.goat-flow/glossary.md`), so it is no longer a live duplicate example but older consumer projects may still have it.

**Impact:** Agents receive contradictory instructions about where to write lessons and footguns. The same information ends up in multiple places and drifts. Users can't tell which is canonical.

**Prevention:** The installer now detects legacy surfaces and emits a `Legacy surfaces detected:` warning block with per-file pointers. It does NOT auto-migrate — content-merge across versions is error-prone and schema-sensitive. Consumer projects on legacy layouts must read the warning, migrate content manually, then re-run `goat-flow audit --check-drift` to confirm the parallels are gone. The footgun stays active until auto-migration is feasible (not planned for 1.2.0).

## Footgun: goat-plan claims "durable shared state" but task files are intentionally gitignored

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-15 | **Resolved:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Resolution:** `goat-plan/SKILL.md` description updated to say "local working state for the current session" instead of "shared state between human and coding agent." Updated across all agent copies (.claude, .agents) and the workflow template.

**Original symptoms:** The skill description over-promised persistence for gitignored task files.

## Footgun: Redundant context files waste token budget on every skill invocation

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-04-16 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** `RULES.md` (432 words) in the goat dispatcher skill loaded on every `/goat` dispatch. 6 of 6 sections duplicated content already in CLAUDE.md and the shared skill preamble. Net unique content: ~30 words. Flagged by a coding agent critique of halaxy-cypress as a framework flaw.

**Why it happened:** RULES.md was created as a standalone "core mandates" file for the mono-skill dispatcher model. When the architecture split into 7 separate skills with a shared preamble (now at `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md`), the preamble absorbed the same rules but RULES.md was never removed.

**Evidence (historical, pre-subdir-move paths):** `RULES.md` sections mapped 1:1 to existing surfaces. Evidence Standard, Severity Scale, and Learning Loop all duplicated content already in the shared preamble; Execution Loop duplicated CLAUDE.md's loop section. Specific line numbers from 2026-04-16 are stale after the `.goat-flow/skill-reference/` subdir move and are no longer recorded here.

**Resolution:** Deleted `RULES.md`. Moved 2 unique lines into the shared preamble's "Engineering Standards" section.

**Prevention:** When adding a new shared-context file, check whether its content already exists in CLAUDE.md or the shared preamble. Before promoting any file to "load on every invocation," verify it provides net-new signal per token.

## Resolved Entries

> Historical record. These entries are no longer active traps.

- **Setup instructions contradict spec on execution loop steps** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Retired `docs/system-spec.md` and `docs/five-layers.md` in v1.1.0; `workflow/setup/reference/execution-loop.md` is now the single authoritative source.
- **Multi-agent setup files share structure but not vocabulary** (resolved 2026-04-14) - Updated Gemini hook event names and settings.json to use correct CLI-specific vocabulary instead of copying Claude's.
- **Workflow skill templates lag behind installed skills** (resolved 2026-04-15) - All 7 templates now match installed skills; preflight validates version parity.
- **Ask First config/instruction sync is documented as blocking but not validated** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Added `normalizePath()` for glob-aware comparison; downgraded Step 06 "BLOCKING" to advisory.
- **Base setup simplification can leave harness checks enforcing removed config fields** (resolved 2026-04-15) - Harness now treats missing `toolchain` and `ask_first` as optional with explanatory findings.
- **Deduplicated multi-agent setup drifts from per-agent setup rules** (resolved 2026-04-13) - Removed `--agent all` and `composeMultiAgentSetup()`; setup now requires explicit `--agent` flag and routes per-agent only.
- **Setup adds skills but never removes them** (resolved 2026-04-15) - The `agent-skills` check in `check-agent-setup.ts` now detects deprecated skill directories. Upgrade docs include explicit deletion instructions. Migration script handles it automatically.
