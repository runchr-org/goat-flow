# Skill Preamble

All goat-* skills read this preamble on every invocation. For full-depth work,
also read `skill-conventions.md`.

---

## Execution Loop Integration

When a goat-* skill is active, the skill's Step 0 satisfies READ/SCOPE. Resume the loop at ACT.

## Severity Scale

SECURITY > CORRECTNESS > INTEGRATION > PERFORMANCE > STYLE

Order findings by severity, not by file or discovery order.

## Evidence Standard

- Every finding MUST include file evidence — either `file:line` when the specific line demonstrates the issue, or `file` when the trap is file-level. Path-only evidence is valid when a line number would be fabricated.
- MUST NOT fabricate file paths, function names, or artifact content
- Before presenting findings, re-read each cited `file:line` to confirm accuracy
- Tag evidence quality: **OBSERVED** (directly verified in code) vs **INFERRED** (deduced but not directly confirmed — state what direct evidence is missing)
- If you cannot re-read the cited evidence before responding, mark the claim **UNVERIFIED**
- Before citing a function or symbol name, verify it exists with a repo search
- Before citing a CLI flag, verify it with `--help` or the command's docs
- Before citing a config key, read the actual config file first

## Universal Constraints

- MUST NOT fabricate file paths, function names, or artifact content
- Before citing a function or symbol name, verify it exists with a repo search
- Before citing a CLI flag, verify it with `--help` or docs
- Before citing a config key, read the actual config file first

## Ceremony Level

Adapt ceremony to complexity. Do NOT run full ceremony on simple tasks.

| Complexity | Ceremony |
|------------|----------|
| Hotfix | Skip goat-plan — just implement directly. Skip goat-sbao entirely. |
| Small Feature | goat-plan: 1-2 milestones, minimal ceremony. Skip goat-sbao. |
| Standard | goat-plan: full milestone breakdown with testing gates. Use goat-sbao if approach is genuinely uncertain. |
| System / Infrastructure | goat-plan: full milestones + cross-boundary verification + rollback planning. goat-sbao strongly recommended. |

## Depth Choice

- **Quick:** compressed workflow, minimal ceremony, direct output
- **Full:** all phases, SBAO/Mob if planning, full output format
- If arriving from the dispatcher with depth already chosen, skip the depth question

## Quick Route

- Bug or symptom? → /goat-debug
- Review a diff or code quality issue? → /goat-review
- What's untested? → /goat-test
- Security concern? → /goat-security
- Need milestones? → /goat-plan
- Want multi-perspective critique? → /goat-sbao
- Planning a feature? → /goat
- Simple implementation? no skill: READ → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY

## No-Skill Fast Path

For Hotfix complexity (1-2 files, obvious change), skip skills entirely.
Use direct execution: READ → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY.

## Footgun Fast-Path

- If Step 0 footgun check surfaces a direct match: surface it immediately and map to the documented mitigation.
- If the match has `hallucination-risk: high`, re-read the live file/config before trusting inferred behavior.
- Continue `READ → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY`; footguns are memory, not an execution substitute.

## Learning Loop

After completing the skill, check if this run uncovered anything worth logging:
- Behavioural mistake → `## Lesson:` entry in `.goat-flow/lessons/` category bucket
- Successful repeatable approach → `## Pattern:` entry in `.goat-flow/patterns.md`
- Architectural trap with file evidence → `## Footgun:` entry in `.goat-flow/footguns/` category bucket

## Human Gates

- **BLOCKING GATE** — stop and wait for human decision. Used for: scope approval, phase transitions, final review.
- **CHECKPOINT** — present status and continue unless interrupted.
