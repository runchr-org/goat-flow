# GOAT Flow

**A dashboard for auditing, configuring, and running your AI coding agents.**

One command opens a local web UI where you can audit your project's agent harness, set up new agents, browse a prompt library, and launch terminal sessions — all from one place. Supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Copilot CLI.

## Dashboard views

### Home

Live audit results for every supported agent. Per-agent cards show pass/fail across two scopes (GOAT Flow Setup, Agent Setup) with actionable fix hints. An AI Harness section scores each agent across five concerns — Context, Constraints, Verification, Recovery, and Feedback Loop — so you can see exactly where your setup is strong and where it's weak. "What to do next" action cards surface the highest-priority gaps. Re-audit after changes without leaving the page.

### Setup

Guided setup flow. Detects your project stack and existing configuration, lets you pick a target agent, then generates a setup prompt you can preview and launch directly in a terminal session. The agent configures your project: instruction file, skills, hooks, and learning loop.

### Prompts

A library of 20+ preset prompts across six categories: critique, debug, plan, QA, review, and security. Two-pane layout with search, category filters, and favorites. Select a prompt and launch it in a new terminal, send it to an active session, or copy it to clipboard. Keyboard-navigable: `/` to search, arrows to browse, Enter to launch.

Prompts include structured workflows like pre-walk-through notes with targeted testing plans, multi-lens critiques, full threat assessments, dependency scans, coverage audits, and milestone planning.

### Workspace

Split layout for terminal work. A sessions rail lists all running terminal sessions (up to 10) with runner, age, and idle indicators. Single-click switching between sessions. The right pane is a full xterm.js terminal with WebSocket-based PTY — run Claude, Codex, Gemini, or Copilot directly in the browser.

### Projects

Multi-project browser. Register multiple project paths, view their audit status at a glance, and "Audit All" in one click. Select a project to switch context across the entire dashboard.

### Quality

Generate agent quality-assessment prompts. Select a target agent, generate the prompt, and preview the full output with embedded audit results.

## What's under the hood

The dashboard is the interface. Underneath, GOAT Flow installs a harness that makes agents more reliable:

| Component | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| **Execution Loop** (READ → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY) | Guessing at unread code, shipping without checks |
| **Skills** (seven `/goat-*` commands + dispatcher) | Free-form prompting that drifts mid-task |
| **Enforcement Hooks** (`deny-dangerous.sh`) | `rm -rf`, force-push, secret file access |
| **Learning Loop** (footguns, lessons, decisions) | Same mistake recurring next session |
| **Autonomy Tiers** (Always / Ask First / Never) | Agent overreach, missed approvals |

Skills have phases and human gates. Hooks intercept tool calls before they execute. The learning loop gets read at session start so mistakes compound into context, not repetition.

## Why not just CLAUDE.md / Cursor rules?

Instruction files tell the agent what to do. They don't enforce it.

|  | Instruction file alone | GOAT Flow |
|---|---|---|
| Tell the agent the rules | yes | yes |
| Block dangerous commands at tool level | no | yes |
| Structured workflows with human gates | no | yes |
| Capture lessons across sessions | no | yes |
| Audit whether setup is actually correct | no | yes |

Use an instruction file for rules the agent should *remember*. Use GOAT Flow for rules the agent cannot *skip*.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js 20+.

### 1. Launch the dashboard

```bash
npx @blundergoat/goat-flow@latest dashboard .
```

No install required. Opens a local web UI against your current directory. Fresh projects show failing audits by design — that's the baseline the setup fills in.

### 2. Run setup from the dashboard

Click **Setup**, pick your agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini, or Copilot), and launch the generated prompt in an integrated terminal. The agent configures your project end-to-end.

Or from the CLI:

```bash
npx @blundergoat/goat-flow@latest setup . --agent claude
```

### 3. Re-audit

Back on the Home view, click **Re-audit**. All checks should pass. The AI Harness cards now show scores across the five concerns.

### 4. Use a prompt

Open the **Prompts** view, pick a workflow (code review, bug diagnosis, security assessment, test planning), and launch it in a terminal session. Each prompt invokes a structured `/goat-*` skill with phases and human gates.

### Install locally (optional)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @blundergoat/goat-flow    # npm
pnpm add -D @blundergoat/goat-flow               # pnpm
```

For the dashboard's embedded terminal, you'll need `node-pty` to compile. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if the terminal doesn't appear.

## Multi-agent support

GOAT Flow supports **Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Copilot CLI**. All agents share the same execution loop, autonomy tiers, skills, and learning loop. The dashboard's runner switcher (top nav bar) lets you toggle between agents and see per-agent audit results side by side.

Run `npx @blundergoat/goat-flow@latest manifest` to inspect the live agent matrix.

## CLI commands

The dashboard covers most workflows visually. For CI or scripting, the same features are available as CLI commands:

```bash
npx goat-flow dashboard .                  # Launch the dashboard
npx goat-flow audit .                      # Run audit (pass/fail output)
npx goat-flow audit . --harness            # Add AI harness scoring
npx goat-flow audit . --format json        # JSON output for CI
npx goat-flow setup . --agent claude       # Generate setup prompt
npx goat-flow quality . --agent claude     # Generate quality-assessment prompt
npx goat-flow status .                     # Project state (bare/partial/v0.9/v1.0/v1.1)
npx goat-flow manifest                     # Agent support matrix
```

See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for the full reference.

## The five harness concerns

Every major source in harness engineering (Hashimoto, Fowler/Böckeler, Anthropic, HumanLayer) converges on the same concerns. The dashboard's AI Harness section scores each agent across all five:

| Concern | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Context** | Is the agent's context accurate, lean, and useful? |
| **Constraints** | Do deterministic rules catch failures before the LLM runs? |
| **Verification** | Can the agent verify its work, and does failure feed back? |
| **Recovery** | Can the agent resume after crash or interruption? |
| **Feedback Loop** | Is the harness getting smarter from failures over time? |

See [docs/audit-and-quality.md](docs/audit-and-quality.md) for the full framework and sources.

## Troubleshooting

**Terminal not showing in dashboard?**
goat-flow installs without a C++ toolchain as of v1.2.4. If you need the dashboard's embedded terminal, you'll also need `node-pty` to compile. Install build tools (`sudo apt install build-essential python3` on Debian/Ubuntu, `xcode-select --install` on macOS), then run `npm rebuild node-pty`. If using pnpm: `pnpm approve-builds` (select node-pty). To skip the native build entirely: `npm install @blundergoat/goat-flow --omit=optional`.

**Audit fails on a fresh project?**
Expected. Open the dashboard Setup view or run `npx @blundergoat/goat-flow@latest setup . --agent claude`.

**Audit still fails after setup?**
Re-run `npx @blundergoat/goat-flow@latest audit . --verbose` to see which check failed. The `howToFix` hint on each failure points at the missing file or config key.

**Agent isn't following the execution loop?**
Restart the agent session after setup so it re-reads the instruction file. Agents only pick up instruction-file changes on session start.

**Setup prompt looks wrong or incomplete?**
Regenerate from the dashboard Setup page, which shows detected stack info alongside the prompt.
