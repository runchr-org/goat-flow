# Contributing to GOAT Flow

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This guide covers environment setup, project layout, and PR workflow.

## Dev Environment Setup

Requires Node.js 20+ and Bash.

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run build        # compile TypeScript (tsc)
npm test             # run the full test suite (960+ tests, node:test)
npm run format       # auto-format with Prettier
```

## Running the Scanner Locally

After building, scan the current project:

```bash
npm run scan                      # shorthand
node dist/cli/cli.js scan .       # direct invocation (accepts any path)
```

## Running the Dashboard in Dev Mode

```bash
npm run dev    # builds, then launches the browser dashboard with --dev flag
```

## Running Preflight Checks

The preflight gate runs typecheck, tests, shellcheck, version consistency, and ADR enforcement:

```bash
bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh
```

For shell scripts only: `shellcheck scripts/maintenance/*.sh`

## Project Structure

| Directory | What lives there |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `src/cli/` | CLI scanner, rubric checks (`rubric/`), stack detector (`detect/`), setup prompt generator |
| `src/dashboard/` | Browser-based dashboard — HTML + Alpine.js + vanilla JS |
| `workflow/` | Setup templates, skill templates, hooks, coding standards |
| `.goat-flow/` | Project-specific config, architecture, decisions, footguns, lessons |
| `scripts/` | Shell scripts for validation, maintenance, publishing |
| `test/` | Unit, integration, contract, and smoke tests (uses `node:test`) |

## How to Add a New Rubric Check

Rubric checks live in `src/cli/rubric/`. The `standard/` subdirectory contains individual check modules; `registry.ts` wires them together. Add your check function, register it, and bump `RUBRIC_VERSION` in `src/cli/rubric/version.ts` if you change scoring.

## How to Add a New Skill Template

Skill templates live in `workflow/skills/`. Each skill has a reference copy in `workflow/skills/reference/` and a user-facing template. The setup process uses a 3-way copy pattern: reference -> project `.claude/skills/` -> user customization. Add your template in both locations and register it in the setup flow.

## How to Add a New Stack to the Detector

Stack detection lives in `src/cli/detect/project-stack.ts`. Add a new detection case that inspects project files (package.json, config files, etc.) and returns the appropriate stack identifier.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch off `dev` (`git checkout -b my-change`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run the checks: `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh`
5. Open a pull request against `dev` (not `main`)

## PR Conventions

- Single-line summary, plain English — no `feat:`/`fix:` prefixes
- Multi-line body when spanning multiple areas (blank line after summary)
- Before opening: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `shellcheck` on any changed `.sh` files must all pass
- See `.goat-flow/coding-standards/git-commit.md` for full conventions

## Code Style

- **Markdown** for documentation (target ~120-line files)
- **Bash** for maintenance and validation scripts (`scripts/`)
- **TypeScript** for the scanner CLI (`src/cli/`) and dashboard server
