# workflow/hooks/

Copyable hook scripts and agent-config templates for the GOAT Flow enforcement layer.

## Hook Scripts

| Script | Event | Required? | Purpose |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| `deny-dangerous.sh` | PreToolUse | Required | Runtime hook. Blocks broad recursive deletion, all git push (ADR-025), GitHub writes via `gh`, chmod 777, pipe-to-shell, .env edits, --no-verify |
| `deny-dangerous.self-test.sh` | Self-test helper | Required with `deny-dangerous.sh` | Sourced by `deny-dangerous.sh --self-test`; keeps the runtime hook smaller without weakening the verification corpus |

## Agent Event Name Mapping

| Purpose | Claude Code | Codex CLI | Antigravity | Copilot CLI |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Block before tool runs | PreToolUse | PreToolUse in `.codex/hooks.json` with the shipped deny hook matched to `Bash` | Not yet wired - upstream hooks directory undocumented at `agy` 1.0.1 (capability-limited; see `.goat-flow/tasks/1.8.0/M02-antigravity-runtime-and-login-proof.md`) | `preToolUse` in `.github/hooks/hooks.json` with the shipped deny hook |
| Permission deny list | `.claude/settings.json` deny patterns | Filesystem permission profile in `.codex/config.toml`; command denies in the Bash hook | None wired - sandbox/approval lives in user-level `~/.config/antigravity/config.toml`, not a repo-local file | Script-only deny hook; no provider-native file-read/file-write deny layer is claimed |
| Config format | JSON | TOML + JSON | n/a | JSON |

## Setup

1. Copy the required hook files to your agent's hooks directory: `deny-dangerous.sh` and `deny-dangerous.self-test.sh`.
2. Copy the matching agent-config template(s) for your runtime:
   - Claude: `agent-config/claude.json` -> `.claude/settings.json`
   - Codex: `agent-config/codex.toml` -> `.codex/config.toml` and `agent-config/codex-hooks.json` -> `.codex/hooks.json`
   - Copilot: `agent-config/copilot-hooks.json` -> `.github/hooks/hooks.json`
   - Antigravity: no template - hook wiring deferred until upstream documents a hooks directory.
3. goat-flow core ships only the deny hook. Post-turn validation hooks are a project-specific concern - see the note below.

All hook paths use `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` so they work regardless of the agent's working directory.

## Post-Turn Linting (project-specific, not shipped)

goat-flow does not ship a post-turn lint hook. Every project has different linters, configs, and performance constraints. If you want post-turn validation, write a project-specific script for the Claude `Stop` or Codex `Stop` event and register it in that agent's settings file. Antigravity's hook event names are not yet documented upstream.

## Codex Permissions

Codex does not read Claude's `settings.json` `permissions.allow` or `permissions.deny` syntax. The equivalent file-access layer is a TOML permission profile selected by `default_permissions` in `.codex/config.toml`; goat-flow's Codex template denies common secret-bearing project subtrees there and leaves `.env.example` to the Bash hook's read-only allowlist. Codex rules must be exact paths that exist in the checkout or trailing `/**` subtrees, so recursive filename globs such as `**/.env.example` cannot be used for `read` access and absent exact paths must not be listed. Shell command patterns still belong in `.codex/hooks.json` through the Bash-matched `PreToolUse` deny hook.
