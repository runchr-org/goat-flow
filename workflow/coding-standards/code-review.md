# Prompt: Create ai/instructions/code-review.md

> **Purpose:** Code review checklist - priority order, anti-patterns, review triggers
> **Generates:** `ai/instructions/code-review.md`
> **Use when:** Setting up code review instructions for the project
> **Repo inspection:** Yes - reads code for actual anti-patterns, file paths, API contracts
> **Follow-on refs:** `security/` for security review additions; `testing.md` for test-coverage expectations

---

## The Prompt

Write `ai/instructions/code-review.md`:

````
IMPORTANT: When listing anti-patterns or review checks, verify each against actual code:
- Do not reference files that don't exist - run ls/find to confirm paths
- Do not list API contracts that aren't implemented - read the source
- Do not include checks for patterns the project doesn't use
- Every file path in backticks must be verified before including it

# Code Review Instructions

## Priority Order

Check in this order. Stop and flag blocking issues before continuing.

1. **Security** - SQL injection, auth bypass, secret leaks, path traversal?
2. **Correctness** - Does the code do what the PR says it does?
3. **Data integrity** - Missing transactions, race conditions, partial writes?
4. **Maintainability** - Can someone else understand this in 6 months?
5. **Performance** - Only flag if measurable (N+1 queries, unbounded loops).

## Approval Criteria

Approve when ALL are true:
- Tests pass and cover the changed logic
- No security issues (load `security.md` if unsure)
- No broken error handling (errors logged or returned, never swallowed)
- Public API changes are backwards-compatible or explicitly versioned
- Database migrations are reversible

## Anti-Patterns to Flag

**Swallowed errors.** Must log or return - never silently drop.
```go
// Bad - error disappears
result, _ := db.Query(query)

// Good - handle it
result, err := db.Query(query)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("list users: %w", err)
}
```

**Unbounded queries.** Every database query must have a LIMIT or pagination.
```sql
-- Bad
SELECT * FROM events WHERE org_id = $1;

-- Good
SELECT * FROM events WHERE org_id = $1 LIMIT 100 OFFSET $2;
```

**Hardcoded secrets or config.** Use environment variables.
```ts
// Bad
const apiKey = "sk-live-abc123";

// Good
const apiKey = process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY;
```

**Missing input validation.** All external input must be validated before use.
```go
// Bad - trusts user input
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    id := r.URL.Query().Get("id")
    db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + id)
}
```

**Overly broad catches.** Catch specific errors, not everything.
```ts
// Bad
try { ... } catch (e) { console.log("something failed"); }

// Good
try { ... } catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof ValidationError) { ... }
  throw e; // re-throw unexpected errors
}
```

## Dependency & Architecture Checks

**Dependency changes:** Any new dependency must justify its addition. Check: is it maintained (last commit)? Are there open CVEs? Are there alternatives already in the project? What's the size impact?
```
# When reviewing a PR that adds a dependency, verify:
1. Lockfile updated (not just package.json / go.mod)
2. No unnecessary transitive dependencies pulled in
3. License is compatible (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD - flag GPL in non-GPL projects)
4. Package is not deprecated or abandoned
```

**Error handling audit:** Every `catch`, `rescue`, `except`, or `if err != nil` must either: handle the error, wrap with context and re-raise, or explicitly document why it's swallowed.
```go
// Flag this in review - swallowed error
result, _ := db.Query(query)

// Flag this - catch-all with no context
try { riskyOp(); } catch (e) { return null; }

// Acceptable - explicitly documented suppression
_, _ = writer.Write(logMsg) // best-effort logging, failure is non-critical
```

**Concurrency review:** Check for shared mutable state, missing locks, race conditions in concurrent code. Use `-race` flag for Go tests, thread sanitizers for C/C++.
```bash
# Go: always run tests with race detector in CI
go test -race ./...

# C/C++: compile with thread sanitizer for concurrency tests
clang -fsanitize=thread -g -o test_binary test.c

# JS/TS: check for shared mutable state in async code
# Flag: module-level let/var mutated inside async functions
```

## Migration & Schema Changes (if the project uses database migrations)

- Migrations must be reversible - include both `up` and `down` (or equivalent rollback).
- Adding a column is safe. Renaming or removing a column is a breaking change - requires a multi-step migration (add new → migrate data → remove old).
- Never modify a migration that has already been applied to shared environments (staging, production). Create a new migration instead.
- Schema changes that touch high-traffic tables should note the lock impact. On large PostgreSQL/MySQL tables, `ALTER TABLE` can hold locks that block reads/writes.

## API Backward Compatibility (if the project exposes APIs consumed by external clients)

- Removing or renaming a field is a breaking change, even if "nobody uses it."
- Changing a field type is a breaking change.
- Adding a new required field is a breaking change. New optional fields are safe.
- Changing HTTP status codes breaks clients that branch on status.
- When a breaking change is unavoidable: version the endpoint, deprecate the old one with a sunset header, and document the migration path.

## Learning Loop Cross-Check

Before approving, check `docs/footguns.md` and `docs/lessons.md` (if they exist) for known traps relevant to the changed files. If a PR touches a file or pattern mentioned in footguns, flag it - even if the code looks correct. Past incidents are the best predictor of future ones.

## Do NOT Nitpick

These are handled by linters - do not comment on them:
- Formatting, whitespace, semicolons
- Import ordering
- Variable naming style (camelCase vs snake_case) unless inconsistent within a file
- Line length (configured in linter)
- Trailing commas
