## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-preamble.md` for shared conventions.
On full-depth, also read `.goat-flow/skill-conventions.md`.
If unavailable, use these essentials:
- Severity: SECURITY > CORRECTNESS > INTEGRATION > PERFORMANCE > STYLE
- Evidence: every finding MUST include file or file:line, tag OBSERVED vs INFERRED
- Learning loop: check .goat-flow/lessons/ and .goat-flow/footguns/ after completion
- Gates: BLOCKING GATE = stop and wait. CHECKPOINT = continue unless interrupted.

## When to Use

Use when work needs breaking into milestones with tracked progress. goat-plan creates and manages milestone files in `.goat-flow/tasks/` — the shared state between human and coding agent.

**Invoke when:**
- A feature, project, or significant change needs structured milestones before implementation
- The dispatcher's Planning Route has produced a brief and now needs milestone breakdown
- A goat-sbao critique recommends restructuring the approach — milestones need rewriting
- Mid-implementation: scope changed, something unexpected happened, milestones need updating
- Resuming work after a break — milestone files show where you stopped and what's next

**NOT this skill:**
- Writing a feature brief → dispatcher Planning Route
- Sharpening requirements → dispatcher Planning Route (mob elaboration)
- Critiquing a plan → /goat-sbao
- Finding testing gaps → /goat-test
- Diagnosing a bug → /goat-debug
- Reviewing code → /goat-review

## Step 0 — Intake

**Check for existing milestones first:**
- Read `.goat-flow/tasks/` for any existing milestone files
- If found: "Milestone files exist for [feature]. Resume from here, update milestones, or start fresh?"
- If found but stale: check `git log --since="2 weeks ago" -- .goat-flow/tasks/` — if code has moved on but milestones haven't been updated, flag it
- Also check for legacy milestone files outside `.goat-flow/tasks/` (for example `milestones/`, `tasks/`). If found, note them so the user knows about existing planning artifacts.

**If starting fresh:**
1. What are we building? (Accept: a brief from the dispatcher, a requirements doc, a conversation summary, or just a description)
2. What's the riskiest part? (This determines which milestone comes first)
3. What would make us abandon this entirely? (Kill criteria)
4. Read `.goat-flow/footguns/` for the target area

**Minimum viable input:** A clear description of what to build. Everything else can be inferred or asked during milestone creation.

**CHECKPOINT:** "Creating milestones for [feature]. Riskiest part: [risk]. Kill criteria: [criteria]. Proceeding to milestone breakdown."

## Phase 1 — Milestone Breakdown

Structure the work into milestones using these archetypes. Adapt the count to the project — small features might need 2, large ones might need 5+.

### Milestone Archetypes

1. **Prove It Works** — Validate the riskiest assumption. Throwaway spike if needed. No polish, no edge cases, no auth. If this fails, we stop before investing further.
2. **Make It Real** — End-to-end pipeline working. Someone other than the builder can test it. The full flow works with real data. Rough edges are fine.
3. **Make It Solid** — Handle edge cases, errors, security, and UX. Incorporate feedback from previous milestones. Shippable after this.
4. **Make It Shine** — Polish, performance, docs, open source prep. Explicitly optional — mark as such.

**Spike-first rule:** If uncertain about a library, API, performance characteristic, or integration point — that uncertainty goes in Milestone 1 as a spike, not Milestone 3 as a risk.

### For each milestone, produce:

- **Objective** — 1-2 sentences: what this milestone proves or delivers
- **Tasks** — Checkboxes. Ordered by dependency. Each task is a concrete action, not a vague goal.
- **Assumptions to validate** — What must be proven true during this milestone (not tasks — beliefs about the system)
- **Exit criteria** — Testable, binary pass/fail. Not "performance is acceptable" — instead "p95 latency under 500ms"
- **Testing gate** — What must be verified before starting the next milestone:
  - Automated: which test commands must pass
  - Manual: what a human must check
  - Acceptance: who signs off (developer self-check, QA review, or stakeholder demo)
- **Kill criteria** — What would make us stop at this milestone rather than continue
- **Depends on** — Which milestone must complete first

### Task quality rules

Good tasks:
- `[ ] Add /api/export endpoint returning CSV for a single report`
- `[ ] Spike: benchmark NeMo VRAM usage with both models loaded — target: under 14GB`
- `[ ] Wire S3 presigned URL generation with 15-minute expiry`

Bad tasks:
- `[ ] Set up the backend` — too vague, what specifically?
- `[ ] Make it work` — not a task, it's a wish
- `[ ] Research options` — open-ended with no exit criteria

Each task should be completable in a single coding session. If it's bigger, split it.

### Assumption tracking

Assumptions are not tasks — they're beliefs about the system that affect the plan:

```markdown
## Assumptions
- [x] NeMo VRAM stays under 14GB with both models loaded (benchmarked in M1)
- [ ] S3 presigned URLs work with our CORS setup (untested)
- [x] sqlc generates correct types for JSONB columns (spike confirmed in M1)
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection handles mid-stream disconnects (assumed, not tested)
```

When an assumption is validated, tick it and note the evidence. When an assumption is invalidated, update the milestone plan immediately — don't continue building on a false premise.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present all milestones. "Approve milestones and start implementing, or adjust?"

## Phase 2 — Write Milestone Files

### Small-work Inline Mode

For Hotfix / Small Feature scope (typically 1-2 milestones, low blast radius), you may deliver milestones inline.

Use this prompt:

> "Would you like milestones in inline form first, or written to `.goat-flow/tasks/` now?"

If the user says proceed inline, present milestone tasks in the chat and continue from there.
If the user prefers files or scope is Standard/System, write each milestone to `.goat-flow/tasks/` as separate files and continue in standard format.

After approval, write each milestone to `.goat-flow/tasks/` as a separate file:

**Filename format:** `M<NN>-<slug>.md`
- `M01-prove-bulk-export.md`
- `M02-end-to-end-pipeline.md`
- `M03-error-handling-and-security.md`

**File format:**

```markdown
# M01: Prove Bulk Export Works

**Status:** not-started | in-progress | testing-gate | complete | blocked | abandoned
**Objective:** Validate that we can queue and process a 500-report export job under 30s.
**Depends on:** none
**Kill criteria:** If export processing exceeds 60s for 500 reports, abandon this approach.

## Assumptions
- [ ] Background job queue can handle 500-item batches (untested)
- [ ] CSV generation library handles unicode correctly (assumed)

## Tasks
- [ ] Add ExportJob model with status enum (queued/processing/complete/failed)
- [ ] Spike: benchmark CSV generation for 500 reports — target: under 10s
- [ ] Wire background job processor with 5-minute timeout
- [ ] Add /api/exports endpoint (POST to queue, GET for status)
- [ ] Add basic error handling (job failure → status:failed with reason)

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] 500-report export completes in under 30s in local dev
- [ ] Failed jobs have a clear error message in the status response
- [ ] Spike benchmark results documented

## Testing Gate
**Automated:** `composer test -- --filter ExportJob`
**Manual:** Trigger a 500-report export via API, verify CSV output, check job status endpoint
**Acceptance:** Developer self-check — demo to self before proceeding to M02
```

**CHECKPOINT:** "Milestone files written to `.goat-flow/tasks/`. Ready to start implementation."

## Phase 3 — Between Milestones

After each milestone, run the testing gate first; any failure is BLOCKING.
Capture what was learned, then re-read the next milestone and update invalidated assumptions, tasks, or exit criteria.
Set status: prior milestone `complete`, next milestone `in-progress`.
**CHECKPOINT:** "Milestone gate passed. Do you want to proceed with M[N+1]?"

If updates are needed mid-flight, follow the detailed milestone retrospective protocol in `skill-conventions.md`; never change milestones silently.

## Constraints

- MUST write milestone files to `.goat-flow/tasks/` for Small Feature and above. For hotfix/small work, inline milestones are allowed.
- MUST check for existing milestone files before creating new ones
- MUST include a testing gate on every milestone — no milestone ships without verification
- MUST re-read and potentially update the next milestone after completing each one
- MUST check kill criteria between milestones — a triggered criterion is a BLOCKING GATE
- MUST tick assumption checkboxes with evidence when validated or invalidated
- MUST present milestone updates to human for approval — never silently change
- MUST order tasks within a milestone so the riskiest work comes first
- MUST ensure each task is completable in a single coding session — split if not
- MUST NOT create vague tasks ("set up backend", "make it work", "research options")
- MUST NOT skip the testing gate between milestones
- Universal constraints from skill-preamble.md apply.
- MUST NOT continue building on an invalidated assumption — update the plan first
- Status tracking: update milestone file status field as work progresses

## Output Format

The output IS the milestone files. No separate report needed.

Summary format for presentation:

```markdown
## Milestones for [feature]

### M01: [name] — [archetype]
**Objective:** [1-2 sentences]
**Tasks:** [N] | **Exit criteria:** [N] | **Testing gate:** [auto + manual + acceptance]
**Kill criteria:** [condition]

### M02: [name] — [archetype]
...

**Total milestones:** [N] | **Estimated sessions:** [rough guess]
**Riskiest milestone:** M[N] because [reason]
**Kill criteria summary:** [what would stop the entire effort]
```
