## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-preamble.md` for shared conventions.
On full-depth, also read `.goat-flow/skill-conventions.md`.
Universal constraints from `skill-preamble.md` apply.

Use when the user describes an outcome and wants the right workflow chosen.

## How It Works

1. **UNDERSTAND** - classify intent and target from the user's request.
2. **GATHER** - collect minimal context: ask-first boundaries, footgun matches, recent git activity, config/architecture if relevant. Format: `User wants [intent] on [target] with boundaries [none / ask-first]. Recent git [summary / none].`
3. **ROUTE** - dispatch to the target skill using the preamble routing table. Include a one-line rationale: "Routing to `/goat-debug` - you described a symptom ([symptom]), and the target is [area]."

## Planning Route

For planning requests, check `.goat-flow/tasks/` for existing plans first.

| Complexity | Approach |
|------------|----------|
| Hotfix | Route to direct execution, no planning needed |
| Small Feature | Compressed brief → `/goat-plan` for 1-2 milestones |
| Standard | Feature brief → mob (optional) → `/goat-plan` |
| System / Infrastructure | Feature brief → mob (recommended) → `/goat-plan` → suggest `/goat-sbao` |

## Handoff

Pass the collected brief and any preselected depth to the target skill.
If the user signals a re-route mid-workflow, preserve context and dispatch again.

## Constraints

- MUST understand intent conversationally, not via keyword lookup.
- MUST ask 0-2 clarification questions max; route with stated assumption if still ambiguous.
- MUST include a one-line route rationale with every dispatch.
- MUST respect explicit skill overrides.
