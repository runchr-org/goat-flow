# Shared Skill Preamble

All goat-* skills follow these shared conventions. Skills inline these
sections rather than referencing this file at runtime. This document is the
canonical source - update here first, then propagate to skill templates.

## Severity Scale

SECURITY > CORRECTNESS > INTEGRATION > PERFORMANCE > STYLE

Order findings by severity, not by file or discovery order.

## Evidence Standard

- Every finding MUST include `file:line` evidence
- MUST NOT fabricate file paths, function names, or behaviour
- Before presenting findings, re-read each cited `file:line` to confirm accuracy
- Tag evidence quality where applicable: **OBSERVED** (directly verified in code) vs **INFERRED** (deduced but not directly confirmed - state what direct evidence is missing)

## Learning Loop

After completing the skill, check if this run uncovered anything worth logging:
- Behavioural mistake (agent did something wrong) → create a new markdown entry in `ai/lessons/` or `.goat-flow/lessons/`
- Architectural trap with `file:line` evidence → create a new markdown entry in `docs/footguns/` or `.goat-flow/footguns/`

Do not append to a monolithic log or directory README. Route team-wide entries to `ai/lessons/` or `docs/footguns/`; route machine/session-only entries to `.goat-flow/lessons/` or `.goat-flow/footguns/`.
Filename conventions:
- Lessons: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- Footguns: `slug.md`

Use the standard entry formats:
```markdown
<!-- Lesson entry -->
---
name: [Title]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
---

**What happened:** [description]
**Evidence:** `file:line` - [what was found]
**Prevention:** [rule to prevent recurrence]
```

```markdown
<!-- Footgun entry -->
---
name: [Title]
status: active
created: YYYY-MM-DD
evidence_type: ACTUAL_MEASURED
---

**Symptoms:** [what breaks]
**Why it happens:** [root cause]
**Evidence:** `file:line` - [what was found]
**Prevention:** [rule to prevent recurrence]
```

## Human Gates

- **BLOCKING GATE** - agent MUST stop and wait for human decision before proceeding. Used for: scope approval, phase transitions where direction changes, final output review.
- **CHECKPOINT** - agent presents status and continues unless the human interrupts. Used for: progress reports between passes, intermediate findings. Format: "Phase N complete. [summary]. Continuing to Phase N+1."

Do NOT auto-advance past any BLOCKING GATE. CHECKPOINTs auto-advance by default.

## Adaptive Step 0

Skills that gather context before acting follow this pattern:

1. Read the user's invocation for context already provided
2. For each Step 0 question: if the answer is already clear from context → **confirm**: "I see [answer]. Correct?" Otherwise → **ask**
3. If ALL questions are answered by the invocation → present a condensed confirmation and proceed
4. If the user says "skip Step 0" or provides a detailed brief → confirm understanding and proceed

**The gate rule:** Step 0 MUST end with the agent presenting its understanding and waiting for the user before proceeding to Phase 1. Auto-detect pre-fills context - it does not replace human confirmation. Bare invocation with no arguments = zero context = ask all structural questions and wait.

Never hard-block when context is already available. The goal is to start moving, not to interrogate.

## Stuck Protocol

If 3 consecutive file reads produce no new signal relevant to the current question:
1. Present what you have so far
2. State what you were looking for and didn't find
3. Ask the human to redirect, narrow scope, or close

## Flush Protocol

If 10+ tool calls pass without a human gate or checkpoint, STOP:
1. Write a 3-sentence status to `.goat-flow/tasks/scratchpad.md` (what you're doing, where you are, what's next)
2. Ask the user: continue, compact, or redirect?

The counter resets at every BLOCKING GATE, CHECKPOINT, or human message.
`.goat-flow/tasks/scratchpad.md` is transient - do not commit it.

## Working Memory

For tasks exceeding 5 turns within this skill:
- Maintain state in `.goat-flow/tasks/todo.md`
- If interrupted or compacted, write `.goat-flow/tasks/handoff.md`

## Autonomy Awareness

Before proposing actions that change files, check the instruction file's Ask First
boundaries. If the proposed change crosses an Ask First boundary, flag it:
"This change touches [boundary]. Proceeding requires approval per Ask First rules."

## Closing Protocol

When the skill completes:
1. If work is incomplete: write `.goat-flow/tasks/handoff.md` using the standard handoff template (Date, Status, Current State, Key Decisions, Known Risks, Next Step)
2. Check the Learning Loop (above) for anything worth logging
3. Suggest the most relevant next skill if applicable (see Chains With in each skill)
4. If `.goat-flow/tasks/logs/` exists: write a session summary to `.goat-flow/tasks/logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-goat-{skill}.md`. If >50 session files, delete the oldest to stay at 50. (Schema in `.goat-flow/tasks/logs/README.md`)
