#!/usr/bin/env bash
# =============================================================================
# migrate-to-1.1.sh - Migrate goat-flow 0.9/1.0 projects to 1.1.0 layout
# =============================================================================
# Usage: bash /path/to/goat-flow/workflow/install-migrate-to-1.1.sh /path/to/project
#
# What it does:
# 1. Migrates docs/footguns.md → .goat-flow/footguns/ (category bucket)
# 2. Migrates docs/lessons.md → .goat-flow/lessons/ (category bucket)
# 3. Migrates docs/decisions/ → .goat-flow/decisions/
# 4. Migrates docs/architecture.md → .goat-flow/architecture.md
# 5. Migrates docs/code-map.md → .goat-flow/code-map.md
# 6. Deletes stale goat-* skill directories
# 7. Removes legacy task/handoff/milestone files
# 8. Updates config.yaml paths if they point to old locations
#
# Safe by design:
# - Never overwrites existing .goat-flow/ content (merges or skips)
# - Creates backups in .goat-flow/_migrated-from-0.9/
# - Dry-run mode by default - pass --execute to actually make changes
