# Prompt: Create tasks/handoff-template.md

Paste this into your coding agent to create the session handoff template.
Use it when work stops mid-task and another session needs to resume
without reconstructing context from scratch.

---

## The Prompt

```
Create tasks/handoff-template.md for this project.

This is a reusable session handoff template. It is copied when an agent
stops with incomplete work. The template itself stays clean.

Create with this structure:

# Agent Session Handoff Template

**Purpose:** When an agent has incomplete work at the end of a session,
copy this template to `tasks/handoff.md` and fill it in. The next session
must read that handoff before doing new work.

**When to create:** If you are stopping with unfinished work, blocked
progress, or a forced rewind after repeated failed attempts.

**When to read:** At the start of a session, check whether
`tasks/handoff.md` exists. If it does, read it first.

---

## Date
[YYYY-MM-DD]

## Status
[In Progress / Blocked / Ready for Review]

## Current State
- What was being worked on
- What is done and not done
- Branch name if relevant
- Files changed this session
- Validation status if anything was run

## Key Decisions Made
- Decision and why it was made

## Known Risks
- Risk and mitigation
- What might break if the next session misses this context

## Next Step
- Exactly what to do first, with file paths
- Which files to read first
- The next concrete validation step if known

USAGE:
When ending a session mid-task, the agent should:
1. Copy this template to `tasks/handoff.md`
2. Fill in all sections with specifics from the current session
3. Leave it in the worktree for the next session to read

Do NOT invent progress, test results, or decisions. If something is
unknown, say it is unknown.
Do NOT commit or push the handoff unless a human explicitly asks.

The next session starts by reading the handoff file before doing
anything else.

VERIFICATION:
- Verify tasks/handoff-template.md exists
- Verify it has the Date, Status, Current State, Key Decisions Made,
  Known Risks, and Next Step sections
- Verify it says when to create and when to read the handoff
- Verify it does not reference stale planning or tracking files that are
  no longer part of the repo
