# Instruction File Sections

These sections go in the project's instruction file. Target: under 120 lines. Hard limit: 150.

## Required Sections

a) Version header (v1.0 - YYYY-MM-DD)

b) Default Execution Loop: READ → CLASSIFY → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY → LOG
   When a goat-* skill is active, the skill's Step 0 satisfies READ/CLASSIFY/SCOPE. Resume the loop at ACT.
   - READ: read relevant files first, never fabricate codebase facts
     (include BAD/GOOD example)
     Cross-doc: MUST read .goat-flow/footguns/ before modifying files
     listed in the Ask First boundaries. Known traps prevent repeat mistakes.
   - CLASSIFY: three signals before acting:
     1. Intent: question (answer it) vs directive (act on it)
     2. Complexity tiers: Hotfix (1-2 files) / Small Feature (compressed brief) /
        Standard / System Change / Infrastructure.
        No fixed read/turn caps. If reads exceed 3x your initial estimate,
        re-classify before continuing.
     3. Mode: Plan / Implement / Explain / Debug / Review
   - SCOPE: declare before acting - files allowed to change, non-goals,
     max blast radius. Expanding beyond scope = stop and re-scope
   - ACT: behaviour per mode as a table. State declaration rule.
     Mode-transition rule: "Switching to [NEW STATE] because [reason]."
     Debug mode: "No fixes until human reviews diagnosis."
     Anti-planning-loop rule. Anti-BDUF guard with BAD/GOOD example
   - VERIFY: continuous test loop. Stop-the-line with two-level
     escalation. Revert-and-rescope tactic.
     Before presenting findings, re-read every `file:line` you plan to cite.
     If you cannot re-read it, mark the claim UNVERIFIED.
     Plan tracking: if working from a plan/milestone file, tick each
     checkbox (`- [x]`) as the task is completed - not at the end.
     Recovery protocols: include 2-3 common failure patterns with fixes
     (e.g., missing context → read X first, out-of-scope → name boundary
     and redirect, conflicting instructions → flag and ask)
   - LOG: MUST update when tripped (DoD gate #4). Use category bucket
     files - do NOT append to a monolithic log and do NOT create one
     file per incident forever.
     Lessons: `.goat-flow/lessons/` category files.
     Patterns: `.goat-flow/patterns.md`.
     Footguns: `.goat-flow/footguns/` category files.
     Decisions: `.goat-flow/decisions/`.
     When-to-use table. Footgun propagation rule.
     Context-based loading rules.
     MECHANICAL TRIGGER (non-negotiable):
     - VERIFY caught a failure in your code → `.goat-flow/lessons/` entry BEFORE DoD
     - A reusable approach worked well → `.goat-flow/patterns.md` entry before closing
     - Human corrected agent behaviour → `.goat-flow/lessons/` entry IMMEDIATELY
     - Discovered architectural trap with file:line evidence → `.goat-flow/footguns/`
     Skip = DoD gate #4 blocks completion. This is not optional.
     Threshold for trigger #1: log when the failure has a non-obvious root
     cause, the same mistake happened twice, or the impact crossed a boundary.
     Don't log routine type errors, lint fixes, typos, or anything the
     linter/compiler would have caught on the next run anyway.
     Session logs: write a summary to `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
     at the end of every significant session. Include: what happened, files changed,
     decisions made, errors, learnings, next steps.
     Dual-agent projects: learning loop files are shared. Read the
     current file before appending to avoid duplicating entries.

c) Autonomy Tiers: Always / Ask First / Never
   - Never tier MUST include:
     1. Overwrite existing files without checking destination (ls before
        mv/cp/Write; use mv -n). Data destruction from blind overwrites
        is unrecoverable for untracked files.
     2. Delete, move, or overwrite 5+ files in one operation without
        first listing targets (ls/find/echo glob) and getting explicit
        confirmation. Bulk deletes are irreversible for untracked files.
   - Adapt Ask First boundaries for THIS project's specific risks
   - Include Ask First checklist. Choose SHORT or FULL form:
     SHORT (2 questions - recommended for most projects):
     1. What else depends on this? [list callers/consumers]
     2. How do I undo this? [exact rollback command]
     FULL (5 items - for high-risk codebases, PHI, or multi-tenant systems):
     1. Boundary touched: [name it]
     2. Related code read: [yes/no]
     3. Footgun entry checked: [relevant entry, or "none"]
     4. Local instruction checked: [local instruction file / .github/instructions/ / none]
     5. Rollback command: [exact command]
   For multi-agent projects, consider extending AGENTS.md with domain
   concepts, key patterns, and deprecation warnings. AGENTS.md can serve
   double duty as execution protocol + domain reference - but watch the
   line budget.

d) Definition of Done: 6 gates
   (1) lint/typecheck passes on changed files
   (2) no broken cross-references introduced
   (3) no unapproved boundary changes
   (4) logs updated if tripped
   (5) current state recorded before stopping incomplete work
   (6) grep old pattern after renames

e) Router table: MUST include at minimum:
     - All 6 skill directories (Claude/Gemini/Codex/Copilot: .claude/skills/, .agents/skills/, .github/skills/)
     - Learning loop directories (`.goat-flow/footguns/`, `.goat-flow/lessons/`)
     - Architecture doc (`.goat-flow/architecture.md`)
     - Config (`.goat-flow/config.yaml`)
     - Any playbooks, profiles, or domain docs relevant to project
     Dual-agent projects: router MUST include the other agent's
     instruction file (AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md).
     (Unrouted files are invisible to the agent - 160x usage uplift
     for referenced tools)

f) Essential commands

If you must weaken a MUST to meet the line target, the target is
wrong - raise it, don't weaken the rule.
Do NOT skip sections (e)-(f) - they are small but required.
