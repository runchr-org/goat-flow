# System Overview

Read this first. This is what you're installing and why.

## When NOT to run setup

If `.goat-flow/config.yaml` exists and its version matches the current goat-flow release, **do not run setup**. The project is already configured. Run `goat-flow scan .` instead and fix any failing checks.

Running setup on an already-current project is destructive — it overwrites adapted content with generic templates.

If the version is older, use the upgrade path instead:
- Old skill names (goat-audit, goat-investigate, etc.) → `workflow/setup/upgrade-0.9.x.md`
- Version < current → `workflow/setup/upgrade-1.0.0.md`

## What goat-flow is

A framework that gives AI coding agents extended memory across sessions. Not documentation, not ceremony, not a quality gate — memory infrastructure.

## The 3 layers

### 1. Instruction file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md)

- The execution loop. Loaded every turn. Governs agent behavior.
- Hard budget: 150 lines (target 120). Frontier models degrade **uniformly** when over-instructed — not sequentially, uniformly. Every instruction gets weaker, not just the last ones.
- Tools mentioned in the instruction file get used 160x more often than unmentioned (GitHub 2,500-repo analysis).
- Router table at the end exploits end-of-context attention.

### 2. Skills (5 functional + 1 dispatcher)

- Plan (goat-plan), test (goat-test), review (goat-review), secure (goat-security), debug (goat-debug).
- Loaded on demand via slash commands. Implementation is what the agent does natively — skills govern everything around it.
- No implementation skill (ADR-019): it would duplicate native behavior or add ceremony to every edit.
- The dispatcher (/goat) is a separate file: its 35-trigger routing table + 11 disambiguation rules would consume half the instruction file budget if inlined.

### 3. .goat-flow/ learning loop (footguns, lessons, decisions, coding-standards)

- AI extended memory. Persists across sessions.
- Empty directories = correctly set up. Empty means "no incidents yet", not "incomplete".

## Why every project gets the full system

- The components are lightweight infrastructure, not ceremony proportional to codebase size.
- A 30-file project still needs security checks, debug workflows, and benefits from footguns carrying forward between sessions.
- Full system: 5 skills + dispatcher, .goat-flow/ learning loop, hooks, config. Nothing is optional based on project size.
- Only size-sensitive guidance: projects with >500 source files should consider local instruction files per major component.

## Development Driven Testing (DDT)

- goat-flow follows DDT, not TDD.
- Loop: code -> manually verify -> preflight checks -> decide if automated test is needed.
- Static analysis and type checking already catch half of what unit tests used to cover. Don't write tests for code that tooling already validates.
- Tests focus on: complex business logic, integration boundaries, regression prevention.

## File ownership rules

Setup only creates/edits files in `.goat-flow/`. Everything else in the project is hands-off.

- **Existing CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md:** Do NOT edit or delete. Copy the existing file to `.goat-flow/` for reference (e.g., `.goat-flow/original-CLAUDE.md`), then create a new lean instruction file. The user's original content is preserved, not destroyed.
- **Exception: goat-flow-generated instruction files** (detectable by version header like `# CLAUDE.md - v1.1.0`): edit in-place for version bumps, section fixes, and maintenance. Do not copy-and-replace files that goat-flow already generated.
- **Existing project files** (`.github/instructions/`, `docs/`, `src/`, etc.): Never edit, never delete. Reference them from the router table.
- **Exception for upgrades:** Older goat-flow versions may have files outside `.goat-flow/` (e.g., `docs/footguns.md`, `tasks/`, `ai-docs/`). These can be migrated during an upgrade.
- If the project has `.github/instructions/`, use them as canonical — don't duplicate into `.goat-flow/coding-standards/`.
- If the project has `docs/footguns.md`, migrate entries to `.goat-flow/footguns/` — don't create a parallel surface.

## Single-agent scoping

Setup for one agent only touches that agent's files. Do not modify other agents' configurations.

- Setting up Claude: touch CLAUDE.md, `.claude/`, and shared `.goat-flow/`. Do NOT touch AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, `.agents/`, `.gemini/`, or their skills.
- Setting up Codex: touch AGENTS.md, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, and shared folders. Do NOT touch CLAUDE.md or `.claude/`.
- Users scan and fix each agent setup separately.

## What "done" looks like

- Every goat-flow directory exists. Config references real paths. Skills installed. Hooks wired.
- The CLAUDE.md reads like it was written by someone who understands the project — not a template with blanks filled in.
- Footguns are real. Ask First boundaries match actual risk surfaces. Commands actually run.
