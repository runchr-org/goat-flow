# Step 01 — System Overview

Read this first. This is what you're installing and why.

## Before you begin

1. Read your agent config file (`agents/claude.md`, `agents/codex.md`, etc.) for paths and agent-specific setup.
2. This setup is for **ONE agent**. Only modify files belonging to the agent specified in the agent config file. Do not touch other agents' instruction files, skills, hooks, or settings.

## State check

If `.goat-flow/config.yaml` exists and its version matches the current goat-flow release, **STOP**. The project is already configured. Run `goat-flow scan . --agent {agent}` instead and fix any failing checks.

If the version is older, use the upgrade path instead:
- Old skill names (goat-audit, goat-investigate, etc.) → `workflow/setup/upgrade-from-0.9.x.md`
- Version < current → `workflow/setup/upgrade-from-1.0.x.md`

## What goat-flow is

A framework that gives AI coding agents structured planning (with SBAO multi-perspective critique and Mob Elaboration), persistent memory across sessions, and mechanical safety guardrails. Three layers:

1. **Instruction file** (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md) — The execution loop, autonomy tiers, definition of done, and router table. Loaded every turn.
2. **Skills** (5 functional + 1 dispatcher) — Plan (with SBAO and Mob Elaboration as core features), test, review, secure, debug. Loaded on demand via slash commands. Install verbatim from templates — do NOT adapt, compress, or rewrite skill content.
3. **.goat-flow/ learning loop** — Footguns (architectural traps with file:line evidence), lessons (behavioural mistakes), decisions (ADRs), patterns (successful approaches), coding-standards, personal-preferences (gitignored). AI extended memory persisting across sessions.

Every project gets the full system. The components are lightweight infrastructure, not ceremony proportional to codebase size. SBAO and Mob Elaboration are the primary planning features — they are never removed, demoted, or auto-skipped.

## File ownership

Setup creates/edits files in `.goat-flow/`, the agent's instruction file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md), and the agent's own directories (see agent config file for "Owns" list — skills, hooks, settings). Everything else in the project is hands-off — do not modify source code, tests, CI, or other agents' files.

NEXT: proceed to `02-instruction-file.md`
