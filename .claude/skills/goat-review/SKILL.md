# /goat-review

## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-preamble.md` for shared conventions.
On full-depth, also read `.goat-flow/skill-conventions.md`.

## When to Use

Use when reviewing a diff, PR, or set of changes. Also for quality audits of a codebase area.

**Boundary:** goat-review owns code quality, style, correctness. goat-security owns threat models, compliance, CVEs, auth boundaries. If you find a security issue, flag it and suggest `/goat-security`.

**NOT this skill:** OWASP assessment → /goat-security. Understanding code → /goat-debug. Generating tests → /goat-test. Planning milestones → /goat-plan. Feature briefs → dispatcher Planning Route.

## Step 0 - Scope, Size, Spec

> "Reviewing [X] -- diff review (quick), or area audit with DoD cross-checks (full)?"

- If user already says "quick" or "full", confirm and continue.
- If arriving from the dispatcher with depth already chosen, skip the depth question.
- If vague, ask one follow-up covering: which files, what concerns you, diff or audit.
- Auto-detect scope: (1) explicit input, (2) staged changes, (3) unstaged changes, (4) git diff.

**Size sizing (before Pass 1):** measure the diff. If it exceeds **20 files OR 3000 changed lines**, propose chunking by file group and ask. If the user proceeds un-chunked, record as `large-diff-unchunked` for Review Integrity.

**Spec source (opt-in):** if `.goat-flow/tasks/.active` exists, read it to find the active plan subdir and scan for a milestone file with `Status: in-progress` or `testing-gate`. If found, offer: "Include Spec Drift check against M[NN] exit criteria?" Default: skip for quick, offer for full. Note the choice in Review Integrity.

**Footgun check:** Read `.goat-flow/footguns/` for entries mentioning the target area. Present matches.

## Diff Review (Quick) — Two-Pass Discipline

The review runs two sequential passes. This is a deliberate reading discipline, not a doer-verifier split: you are the reviewer throughout, Pass 2 is the source of truth, and findings are only surfaced after Pass 2.

### Pass 1 — Blind Suspicion (diff only)

Read the diff **without opening full files**. The point is to see what the diff itself reveals before the author's surrounding code anchors you.

Scan for:
- **Severity cues:** auth/permission checks, secret handling, SQL/shell/API calls, data mutation, state transitions
- **Edge-case sweep — 5 meta-categories, specifics bubble up as the diff warrants:**
  - *Boundary conditions* — off-by-one, pagination/index bounds, empty collections, integer overflow
  - *Nullish values* — null / undefined / default branches, missing optional fields
  - *Concurrency* — race windows, shared state, concurrent access
  - *Error handling* — timeouts, retries/backoff, silent exception swallowing
  - *Contract changes* — signature, return type, error channel, status code, event shape

Write raw suspicions with `file:line` drawn from the diff. Do NOT verify, confirm, or dismiss in this pass. Over-capture is fine; Pass 2 filters.

### Pass 2 — Grounded Verification (full files)

Now read full files for context. For each Pass-1 suspicion:

- **Try to DISPROVE it** (negative verification). Re-read the `file:line`, look for a guard, an upstream check, a framework mitigation, or a contract that removes the risk.
- Mark each suspicion: **CONFIRMED** / **REFUTED** / **UNRESOLVED**. Drop REFUTED.
- Add findings that only became visible with file context (integration breakage, call-site contract mismatch, regression in a sibling file).
- Re-verify every `file:line` reference exists before writing the final output.

### Severity + Action Tagging

Every surfaced finding gets two orthogonal tags:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| MUST | fix before merge; blocks approval |
| SHOULD | fix before merge unless disputed |
| MAY | nice-to-have |

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| patch | fix direction is unambiguous — a coding agent can apply it |
| needs-decision | correct fix requires human input (policy, product call, trade-off) |
| pre-existing | bug exists in unchanged code (see separation below) |

Finding line prefix: `[SEVERITY:ACTION]`. Example: `[MUST:needs-decision]`.

### Pre-existing Separation

- **Pre-existing Nearby** (in-scope surface): a pre-existing bug in the same function or tightly-coupled call-site the diff touches. Surface as a one-line pointer under `## Pre-existing Nearby`. Does not block.
- **Pre-existing Issues** (out-of-scope): pre-existing bugs outside the diff's surface. List under `## Pre-existing Issues` without severity tags. Does not block.

### Footgun Cross-Check

Check each finding against `.goat-flow/footguns/`. When a direct match exists, include it. Omit the footgun tag when no direct match is found.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present findings using Output Format below, then pause for human to drill in.

**DoD gate:** (1) tests/lint pass (2) no broken cross-references (3) no unapproved boundary changes (4) grep old pattern after renames.

**Proof Gate:** Apply the Proof Gate from `skill-preamble.md` to every surfaced finding — each `file:line` must be re-read fresh in this session before presentation; downgrade any finding whose evidence cannot be re-verified to UNVERIFIED.

## Area Audit (Full)

When the target is a codebase area (not a diff). For >20 files, recommend splitting. Two-pass discipline still applies per file cluster: skim the surface for suspicions, then open files for verification. Pre-existing issues ARE in scope (they are the point of an area audit).

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present findings and pause. If calibration is uncertain, consider `/goat-sbao`.

## Spec Drift (opt-in)

Only emitted when the Step 0 prompt was accepted and a live milestone file was found. Reads the milestone's **Exit Criteria** and **Assumptions** blocks, then splits output by direction — the two cases surface under different sections and carry different weight:

- **Exit-criteria drift → advisory, no severity tag.** A criterion is marked `- [x]` (done) in the milestone but the diff does not support it. The *milestone* is stale. Surface under `## Spec Drift` prefixed `[advisory]`. Do NOT tag MUST/SHOULD/MAY — this is milestone hygiene for the human to reconcile, not a code defect.
- **Assumption invalidation → review finding with severity.** The diff makes a milestone Assumption false. The *plan* is now broken and the human must choose (update the assumption, fix the diff, or abandon). Surface under `## Findings` as `[MUST:needs-decision]`, **not** under `## Spec Drift`.
- **Open criterion now satisfied → ready-to-tick note.** An open `- [ ]` criterion is now supported by the diff. Surface under `## Spec Drift` prefixed `[ready-to-tick]`. Advisory only — human ticks the milestone file.

If no drift, no invalidation, and no ready-to-tick criteria, still emit the section with "No drift detected against M[NN]" so the reader knows the check ran.

## Review Integrity (confidence signal)

Every review ends with this section. It is the anti-hallucination surface — the reader should be able to tell at a glance how confident the review is.

List:
- **Files opened in Pass 2:** count / total in diff. List paths that were read diff-only.
- **Evidence tags:** N OBSERVED / M INFERRED across findings.
- **Size:** lines changed, files changed. If chunked, state which group was reviewed and which are pending.
- **Degradation flags** (any that apply): `chunked-partial`, `large-diff-unchunked`, `high-inference-ratio`, `files-not-opened`, `unfamiliar-area`, `missing-types`, `spec-drift-skipped`, `footguns-unread`.
- **Conclusion:** `confident` | `coverage-degraded` | `high-inference` | `partial`.

Never leave this section empty. "confident — no degradation flags" is the minimum.

## Constraints

**Diff review (quick):**
- MUST run Pass 1 (diff only) before opening any full files in Pass 2
- MUST NOT surface Pass-1 suspicions that Pass 2 refuted
- MUST NOT flag pre-existing issues as blocking the change

**Area audit (full):**
- MUST scan the declared area regardless of recent changes
- Pre-existing issues ARE in scope

**Both modes:**
- MUST tag every surfaced finding with `[SEVERITY:ACTION]`
- MUST check each finding against `.goat-flow/footguns/`; omit the tag when no direct match
- MUST order findings by severity, not by file or discovery order
- MUST emit Review Integrity on every run
- MUST propose chunking when the diff exceeds 20 files OR 3000 changed lines
- MUST emit Spec Drift only when opt-in triggered; if skipped, log `spec-drift-skipped` in Review Integrity
- MUST split Spec Drift output by direction: exit-criteria drift as `[advisory]` (no severity tag), assumption invalidation as `[MUST:needs-decision]` under `## Findings`, open-criterion satisfaction as `[ready-to-tick]`
- MUST attempt to disprove each Pass-1 suspicion during Pass 2
- MUST group 3+ related findings as systemic patterns
- MUST NOT make file edits in review or audit mode unless the user says "implement"
- MUST NOT frame Pass 1/Pass 2 as doer/verifier — same reviewer, structured reading discipline (ADR-019)
- Universal constraints from skill-preamble.md apply.

- [MUST:needs-decision] **[title]** `file:line` — [desc] | ...

### SHOULD
- [SHOULD:patch] ...

### MAY
- [MAY:patch] ...

## Spec Drift   <!-- only when opt-in triggered; otherwise omit and log spec-drift-skipped -->
<!-- advisory-only entries (exit-criteria drift, ready-to-tick); assumption invalidation goes under ## Findings as [MUST:needs-decision] -->
- [advisory] **[criterion title]** — claimed done in M[NN] but not supported by diff
- [ready-to-tick] **[criterion title]** — now satisfied by diff, milestone still shows `- [ ]`

## Pre-existing Nearby  <!-- in-function only; one-liners; no blocking tags -->

## Pre-existing Issues  <!-- out-of-scope pre-existing bugs -->
