# /goat-review

## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-conventions.md` for full shared conventions.
If unavailable, use these essentials:
- Severity: SECURITY > CORRECTNESS > INTEGRATION > PERFORMANCE > STYLE
- Evidence: every finding MUST include file:line, tag OBSERVED vs INFERRED
- Learning loop: check .goat-flow/lessons/ and .goat-flow/footguns/ after completion
- Gates: BLOCKING GATE = stop and wait. CHECKPOINT = continue unless interrupted.
- Task tracking: tick checkboxes immediately when completed, not at the end.

## When to Use

Use when reviewing a diff, PR, or specific set of changes before they ship.
Also use for systematic quality audits of a codebase area - before releases,
after major changes, or when code quality is uncertain.
Also use for reviewing instruction files for staleness - see modes below.
Also use for improving readability, naming, and code clarity - see Simplify Mode.

**Boundary with /goat-security:** goat-review owns: code quality, style, hook correctness, instruction staleness. goat-security owns: threat models, compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), dependency CVEs, auth/authz boundaries. If you find a security issue during review, flag it and suggest `/goat-security` for deeper assessment.

**NOT this skill:**
- OWASP-driven security assessment → /goat-security
- Understanding unfamiliar code before changing it → /goat-debug (investigate mode)
- Generating test instructions → /goat-test

## Step 0 - Gather Context

**Structural questions (always ask or confirm):**
1. Which files or area? (or I'll run `git diff` to find recent changes)
2. What's the concern? (performance, security, correctness, readability - or "general review")
3. Diff review or full audit? (I'll auto-detect from whether changes exist)

**Illustrative questions (adapt):**
4. Is this responding to external feedback? (another agent, team review, etc.)
5. Riskiest change first, or full sweep?
6. Are there requirements for this work? (file path, pasted issue/ticket content, or skip)

**Escape hatch:** If the user says "just review what changed" or provides minimal info, auto-detect scope from `git diff --stat` and proceed.

**Auto-detect mode (unless user explicitly specifies):**

Scope detection priority: (1) explicit user input, (2) staged changes to target, (3) unstaged changes to target, (4) git diff. If user names a specific file, use THAT - not the full worktree diff. If worktree is very dirty (20+ changed files), ask user to specify scope.

- User names a diff/PR/commits → **Standard mode** (Phases 0-4)
- User names a file AND `git diff --stat` shows changes to it → **Standard mode**
- User names a file AND no changes exist → **Audit mode** (Phases A1-A3)
- Target is **instruction files** → **Instruction mode** (Phases 1i-3i)
- Goal is **readability/cleanup** → **Simplify mode** (Phases S1-S4)
- User explicitly says "audit" or "standard" → respect override

If `.goat-flow/coding-standards/code-review.md` exists, load it and apply project-specific
review standards alongside these defaults.

**Footgun check:** If `.goat-flow/footguns/` exists, read entries mentioning the target area. If a match is found, present it: "This area has a known issue: [footgun]. Relevant?"

**Before proceeding:** present what you know and what you still need. Wait for the user to confirm scope, mode, and concerns before entering Phase 1.

## Phase 1 - Scope Confirmation

**CHECKPOINT:** "I'll review [N] files about [area]. Focus on [concern]?
Anything I should prioritize?"

## Phase 2 - Review

Review the DIFF for issues. Read FULL FILES for context. Do not flag
pre-existing issues as part of this change - note them separately.

**Severity-ordered scan:**
1. Security: injection, auth bypass, secret exposure, permission escalation
2. Correctness: logic errors, edge cases, null handling, race conditions
3. Integration: API contract changes, cross-boundary effects, breaking changes
4. Performance: O(n²) in hot paths, unbounded queries, memory leaks
5. Style: naming, formatting, convention violations (lowest priority)

**Cross-cutting checks:**
- Autonomy tier violations: does this change cross an Ask First boundary?
- Footgun matching: check each finding against `.goat-flow/footguns/`. Output: `MATCH: [entry]` or `CLEAR`
  *Example:* "Finding: Renamed `UserService` → `AccountService`. Footgun check:
  `.goat-flow/footguns/` entry 'cross-reference fragility'. MATCH - grep for
  `UserService` across all `.md` files."
- Pattern drift: does new code use a different pattern than existing codebase? Don't assume it's wrong - ask: "Intentional divergence?"
- Downstream impact: "What breaks if this change has a bug?" - map the cascade
- Test execution gaps: tests exist but weren't run against the changed path (different from "no test exists")
- Glossary consistency: if `.goat-flow/glossary.md` exists, flag terms used inconsistently in the diff (different name for same concept)

**Requirements cross-reference:** If requirements were provided in Step 0, cross-reference acceptance criteria against the implementation. Flag unmet criteria as MUST-fix findings.

**Self-check:** Before presenting, re-verify `file:line` references for all MUST-fix findings.

## Phase 3 - Present Findings

Use the Output Format template below. Additional required sections for reviews:

**Pre-existing Issues** (not blocking this change):
- [issue] - `file:line` - existed before this diff

**Breaking Changes:**
- [change] - affects: [consumers] - migration needed: [yes/no]

**Test Execution Gaps:**
- [test exists at file:line] but doesn't exercise the changed path because [reason]

**What's Good:**
- Specific positive observations (not generic praise)

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present findings. Offer:
(a) drill into a specific finding
(b) review a related area
(c) check test coverage
(d) something else

## Phase 4 - DoD Gate Check

Verify the project's Definition of Done against this change:
1. Tests/lint pass on changed files
2. No broken cross-references introduced
3. No unapproved boundary changes
4. Logs updated if VERIFY caught a failure
5. Working notes current
6. Grep old pattern after renames - zero remaining

**CHECKPOINT:** "DoD check: [pass/partial/fail]. [Details]."

## Audit Mode

Activated when Step 0 target is a codebase area (not a specific diff or PR).
Use for systematic quality review - before releases, after major changes,
or when code quality is uncertain.

**Scope guidance:** For >20 files, recommend splitting into focused audits.

**Phase A1 - Scan:**

Scan categories, weighted by audit purpose:

| Category | Security audit | Consistency audit | General |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Security | Critical | Medium | High |
| Correctness | High | Medium | High |
| Cross-reference integrity | Medium | Critical | Medium |
| Test coverage | Medium | Low | High |
| Performance | Low | Low | Medium |
| Consistency | Low | Critical | Medium |
| Style | Low | Low | Low |

For each finding, log: category, `file:line`, description, severity.

**Recurrence check:** Before reporting, search `.goat-flow/footguns/` for entries
in the scanned area. Cross-reference findings with known footguns.

**Phase A2 - Verify & Self-Check:**

**A) Negative verification:** For each finding, attempt to DISPROVE it.
Re-read the code at the cited `file:line`. Look for evidence that contradicts
the finding. The goal is adversarial: "Can I prove this finding is wrong?"
Remove genuine false positives.

*Example:* "Finding: No input validation on `/api/users`. Disproof attempt:
checked middleware chain - `express-validator` at `middleware.ts:12` handles
this route. Result: FALSE POSITIVE, removed."

**B) Fabrication self-check:** Re-verify every `file:line` reference.
Does the file exist? Does the cited line contain what the finding claims?

**Self-diagnostic ratios:**
- If >50% of findings removed → initial scan was too noisy. Note this.
- If >20% removed by fabrication check → agent was confabulating. Flag to user.

**Phase A3 - Rank & Rollup:**

Rank surviving findings by severity (see Shared Conventions above).

**Pattern rollup:** If 3+ findings share a root cause, group them:
"This is a systemic pattern, not [N] separate issues: [pattern description]."

**Out-of-scope findings:** Issues discovered outside the declared scope go
in a separate section - don't bury them, but don't let them dilute the audit.

**Anti-fix discipline:** Audit findings report problems - they don't propose fixes.
Review your output for fix language. Rephrase any recommendations as findings.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present findings using the Output Format template below. Offer:
(a) drill into a specific finding
(b) expand to a related area
(c) check a specific category more deeply
(d) close the audit

## Instruction Review Mode

Activated when review target is instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md,
.goat-flow/coding-standards/, .github/instructions/).

**Phase 1i - Friction Signal Scan:**
Gather observable signals (not conversation memory - agents can't read prior sessions):
- `git log --oneline -20` for recent activity patterns
- Read `.goat-flow/lessons/` for entries since last instruction update
- Read `.goat-flow/footguns/` for entries in areas governed by the instructions

**Phase 2i - Instruction Audit:**
For each instruction file, check:
- Missing rules: friction signals suggest a rule that doesn't exist
- Misleading rules: rules that don't match current code behaviour
- Stale rules: references to files/paths that no longer exist
- Outdated rules: rules from a previous architecture that hasn't been updated

**Phase 3i - Propose Edits:**
Present proposals in diff-like format:

| File | Section | Current | Proposed | Why |
|------|---------|---------|----------|-----|
| CLAUDE.md | Ask First | `src/old-path/` | `src/new-path/` | Path renamed in commit abc123 |

MUST NOT auto-edit instruction files. Present for human approval.
MUST NOT edit `.goat-flow/footguns/` or `.goat-flow/lessons/` - those have their own update standards.

---

## Simplify Mode

Activated when goal is readability improvement. **MUST NOT change behavior.**

**Quick path:** For a single function or ≤50 lines: skip S1 scope confirmation.

### Phase S1 - Read & Assess
**Footgun check:** Read `.goat-flow/footguns/` for target area.

Read target files. Assess: Can a new reader understand without context? Are names self-explanatory? Do comments add value? Is control flow easy to follow?

### Phase S2 - Identify Opportunities
Scan by impact:

| Category | What to look for | Impact |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Naming | Cryptic names, abbreviations, misleading names | High |
| Self-documentation | Code that requires comments to explain intent | High |
| Comment quality | Commented-out code, outdated comments, comments restating code | Medium |
| Complexity | Deep nesting (>3 levels), long functions (>40 lines) | Medium |
| Constants | Magic numbers, hardcoded strings | Medium |
| Dead code | Unused imports, unreachable branches | Low |

**The naming test:** "Would a new reader understand this name without reading the implementation?"

**Refactor boundary:** If a rename crosses file boundaries or changes a public API → redirect to /goat-plan (refactor mode).

**Intentional complexity:** Crypto, parsers, performance-critical paths → flag as "complex by design."

### Phase S3 - Self-Check & Present
Re-read each `file:line`. Is the suggested rename safe? Remove findings where evidence doesn't hold.

Present ordered by impact. **BLOCKING GATE:** (a) implement all, (b) implement selectively, (c) drill in, (d) close

### Phase S4 - Implement (if approved)
Apply one file at a time. After each:
1. Grep for old names - zero remaining
2. Check doc cross-references
3. Run tests/linter - behavior unchanged

If tests fail → revert that change, note as unsafe, continue with rest.

## Common Failure Modes

1. **One-shot dump** - agent produces entire review at once instead of conversational drilling. Present findings by severity tier, pause between tiers.
2. **File-order findings** - agent lists findings in the order files were read, not by severity. Force severity ordering.
3. **Footgun skip** - agent skips footgun matching under token pressure. This is where the highest-value findings come from.
4. **Fix proposals in audit mode** - agent recommends solutions instead of reporting findings. The anti-fix discipline check prevents this.
5. **Rubber-stamp self-check** - agent confirms its own findings without re-reading. The fabrication ratio threshold catches this.

## Constraints

<!-- FIXED: Do not adapt these -->
- MUST review the diff for issues, read full files for context
- MUST NOT flag pre-existing issues as part of this change (review mode)
- MUST check each finding against `.goat-flow/footguns/` (MATCH/CLEAR)
- MUST order findings by severity, not by file or discovery order
- MUST NOT fabricate file paths or function names
- MUST NOT make file edits in review or audit mode - report findings only. Only edit if user explicitly says "implement".
- MUST NOT auto-edit instruction files in instruction review mode
- MUST attempt to disprove each finding in audit mode (negative verification)
- MUST NOT propose fixes in audit mode - audit reports only
- MUST re-verify file:line references in audit self-check
- MUST group 3+ related audit findings as systemic patterns
- MUST NOT change behavior in simplify mode
- MUST NOT rename public/exported APIs without explicit approval (simplify mode)
- Conversational: present findings, then let the human drill in. One-shot dumps miss architectural problems.

```markdown
## TL;DR
<!-- 3 sentences: what was reviewed, what was found, what matters most -->

## Findings
