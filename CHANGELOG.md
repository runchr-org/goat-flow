# Changelog

## Unreleased

Skill-compliance trio (drift detection, content linting, manifest), skill renames, audit subsystem expansion, goat-review hardening, and shared proof-gate. 130 files changed (33 added, 1 deleted, 11 renamed), 8 new test files, 4 new ADRs (043-046, ADR-033 renamed). Milestones M01-M07 shipped from the 1.2.0 plan; M08-M16 in progress.

- **Skill Renames (M07)** - `goat-sbao` → `goat-critique` and `goat-test` → `goat-qa`. Mechanical rename only — behaviour, step structure, routing semantics, and the SBAO-as-core-feature stance from ADR-033 preserved. Old names recorded in `workflow/manifest.json:stale_names` for orphan detection. ADR-046.
- **CLI: critique → quality** - `goat-flow critique` → `goat-flow quality`. Dashboard view, `/api/critique` → `/api/quality`, prompt title, `compose-critique.ts` → `compose-quality.ts`, `critique.html` → `quality.html`, `docs/audit-and-critique.md` → `docs/audit-and-quality.md`, `harness-critique-quality.md` → `harness-quality.md`. Pairs cleanly with `audit`: audit answers "is it installed?", quality answers "is it any good?".
- **Harness Check Type Tagging (M01)** - 16 harness checks split into `integrity`/`advisory`/`metric` types. Score reflects integrity + unacknowledged advisory only; maturity surfaced as counts, not failures. New `harness.acknowledge: [check-id]` config opts out deliberate skips. Resolves halaxy-cypress field report where stale architecture.md path (drift) and missing compaction hook (best practice) were framed identically as "failing concerns".
- **Hallucination Red-Flags (M02)** - Five red-flag rules added to CLAUDE.md VERIFY phase: tests-pass evidence requirement, completion claim files-list requirement, fix verification reproduction steps, no-hedged-claims rule, check-passed verbatim-output requirement. Counter-rationalization patterns inline.
- **Active-Plan Marker (M03)** - `.goat-flow/tasks/.active` marker file tells `/goat` and `/goat-plan` which `tasks/<version>/` directory is live, so agents stop starting work in `_archived/` clutter (~400 files). Skill files (`goat`, `goat-plan`) updated to consult the marker. ADR-043.
- **Skill Drift Detection (M04)** - New `goat-flow audit --check-drift` compares installed `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `.gemini/skills/` against `workflow/skills/` templates. Reports diverged, missing, and orphan skills. Backs M07 rename rollout and gates M08 propagation.
- **Cold-Path Content Linting (M05)** - New `goat-flow audit --check-content` lints `docs/`, `.goat-flow/`, ADRs, footgun and lesson entries for vague instructions, missing provenance frontmatter, and factual drift. Owns the provenance schema (`src/cli/audit/provenance-types.ts`) that M11 will back-fill onto existing audit checks.
- **Single Source of Truth Manifest (M06)** - New `goat-flow manifest` command (validate, list, show) plus `src/cli/manifest/{manifest.ts,types.ts,consumers.md}`. Extends `workflow/manifest.json` to host duplicated facts (skill list, audit check counts, version pins) consumed by setup prompts, audit, dashboard, and docs. Snapshot at `workflow/manifest-snapshots/v1.1.0.json` for diff-based drift detection.
- **Snapshot + Factual Claim Checks** - New `check-snapshot-claims.ts` and `check-factual-claims.ts` validate doc claims (skill counts, version strings, audit check counts) against the manifest. Integrated into `audit --check-content` output.
- **goat-review Hardening** - Two-pass reading protocol (skim then deep-dive). Severity (BLOCK/WARN/NOTE) and action (FIX/INVESTIGATE/ACCEPT) tags on every finding. Spec-drift detection lane. New "Review Integrity" self-check section. Edge-case scanning categories expanded. Skill description rewritten.
- **Proof-Gate** - Shared verification gate consumed by `goat-debug`, `goat-qa`, `goat-review`, `goat-security`. Forces named evidence (file:line, exit codes, output transcripts) before declaring work done. Skill patches applied across all four.
- **Audit Counts Sync** - Hot-path docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`) aligned to 13 setup checks + 4 per-agent checks = 17. Preflight B.8a3 added as downstream drift guard. `goat-plan` SKILL.md re-synced. AGENTS.md DoD and hook paths re-aligned.
- **Dashboard Home Cards** - Home view rewritten (`src/dashboard/views/home.html`, ~286 lines) for human-friendly AI harness presentation per ADR-044. Preset prompts and dashboard `globals.d.ts` updated.
- **Documentation** - `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` switched to `npx goat-flow` invocations and added type-checking step. New `.goat-flow/tasks/README.md` and `.goat-flow/scratchpad/README.md` clarify the local-only WIP convention. Per-directory `.gitignore` files updated.
- **ADRs** - ADR-043 (active-plan marker), ADR-044 (human-friendly AI harness home cards), ADR-045 (no goat-verify skill), ADR-046 (rename sbao→critique, test→qa). ADR-033 renamed `sbao-mob-core-features` → `critique-mob-core-features` and content updated to match the M07 rename. Existing ADRs 017/019/030 touched up for terminology consistency.
- **Skill Files** - 7 canonical skills synced across `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `workflow/skills/`: `goat`, `goat-critique` (was goat-sbao), `goat-debug`, `goat-plan`, `goat-qa` (was goat-test), `goat-review`, `goat-security`. `skill-preamble.md` updated.
- **Tests** - 8 new test files: `audit-drift.test.ts`, `verification-boundaries.test.ts`, `check-content-quality.test.ts`, `check-drift.test.ts`, `check-factual-claims.test.ts`, `check-snapshot-claims.test.ts`, `manifest.test.ts`, `provenance-types.test.ts`. `critique-command.test.ts` renamed to `quality-command.test.ts`. `preamble-sync.test.ts`, `audit-command.test.ts`, `provenance-types.test.ts` expanded. ~1,900 net test lines added.
- **Lessons + Footguns** - Updates to `.goat-flow/lessons/{verification,agent-behavior,design-decisions}.md`, `.goat-flow/footguns/skills.md`, and `.goat-flow/glossary.md` (6 previously-undefined terms added: CSO, rationalization table, harness, concern, integrity/advisory/metric, rubber-stamp).
- **In Progress (1.2.0 plan, not yet shipped)** - M08 (skill TDD + rationalization tables, 0/46), M09 (structured learning loop, 2/15), M10 (progressive-disclosure retrieval, 0/27), M11 (back-fill provenance on existing audit checks, 0/39), M12 (multi-agent support matrix, 0/34), M13 (quality persistence + score trend, 0/64), M14 (harness constraint registration, 0/19), M15 (goat-security core, 4/195), M16 (upstream spec-drift sentinel, 0/22). Tracked in `.goat-flow/tasks/1.2.0/`.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-04-17

Scanner/rubric system removed. Replaced by deterministic audit with 16 build checks (12 project setup + 4 per-agent) and 16 advisory harness checks across 5 concerns. Deterministic install script. Dashboard overhaul with dynamic recommended actions. 528 files changed.
- 
- **Critique Fixes** - Dual-critique synthesis resolved 10 findings. Fixed architecture.md build check count (17→16). Removed stop-lint.sh from core (project-specific concern, will revisit in a later version). Resolved 3 stale footgun entries (advisory hooks, swallows failures, dispatcher verb gap). Removed dead goat-review "code-review instruction file" reference. Reworded goat-test "multi-model" to actionable "cross-agent verification". Added analyse/evaluate/critique verbs to dispatcher disambiguation table. Improved critique prompt with 7 refinements: no-mutation warning, audit PASS caveat, severity definitions, scoped tool guidance, footgun currency checks, numeric claim verification, skill testing clarification.
- **Audit System** - Replaced scanner/rubric engine (79 checks + 12 anti-patterns, point-based scoring) with audit system. 12 project-wide setup checks (config, directories, required files) are agent-agnostic. 4 per-agent checks (instruction file, skills, settings, deny-dangerous hook) run independently per agent. Advisory harness scoring (`--harness`) grades 5 concerns with 16 checks total: context, constraints, verification, recovery, feedback loop. ADR-036.
- **Install Script** - `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh` handles all mechanical file copying: 7 skill templates, hooks, settings, templates, reference files, config scaffold. Deterministic, agent-aware (`--agent claude|codex|gemini`), idempotent. Migration script moved to `workflow/install-migrate-to-1.1.sh`.
- **Setup Prompts** - Stripped stack/toolchain info, signal-driven tasks, stale artifact cleanup, multi-agent consistency directives. Setup prompt now: run install script → follow numbered setup steps → verify with audit. Upgrade prompt (v0.9/v1.0) structured as numbered steps with scripts first.
- **Dashboard** - Dynamic recommended actions panel: setup failing → fix wizard + fix agent buttons; harness checks failing → fix harness buttons; quality < 100% → fix harness buttons with per-concern recommendations; healthy → review/test/security presets. Per-agent harness score cards with grade, concern bars, and expandable recommendations. Projects page sorts alphabetically, clicks navigate to home view.
- **Config Agent Filtering** - Auditor respects `config.yaml` agents list. Project setup checks are agent-agnostic. Per-agent checks only run for agents with instruction files present. Config always lists all three agents (claude, codex, gemini) - setup is per-agent, not project-locked.
- **CLI Renames** - `--quality` → `--harness`. `quality-checks.ts` → `harness-checks.ts`. `build-checks.ts` → `agent-setup-checks.ts`. Dashboard label "AI Harness Checks" → "Agent Setup Checks".
- **Critique** - `goat-flow critique . --agent claude` generates agent-driven review prompts from audit data. Separate from audit (subjective vs deterministic).
- **Security** - `execSync` → `execFileSync` in hook syntax validator (shell injection fix). Host header validation on all dashboard API routes.
- **Skills** - 7 canonical skills (goat, goat-debug, goat-plan, goat-review, goat-sbao, goat-security, goat-test). Quick/full depth modes. Conversational structure with Step 0 adaptive gate. Skills installed verbatim from templates - project-specific context comes from instruction file and `.goat-flow/` docs.
- **Setup Flow** - 6 numbered steps (system overview → instruction file → install skills → architecture/code-map → customise → verification). Agent-specific configs in `workflow/setup/agents/`. Upgrade paths for v0.9 and v1.0 projects.
- **Hooks** - `deny-dangerous.sh` supports stdin and argv input, `--self-test` flag, blocks `rm -rf`, force push, `--no-verify`, `chmod 777`, pipe-to-interpreter patterns. Post-turn lint hook removed from core - project-specific concern (see `workflow/hooks/README.md`).
- **Templates** - 5 project templates (feature-brief, mob-elaboration, compliance-checklist, flow-diagram-guide, requirements-template) remain in `workflow/templates/` as reference material. Removed from core install (no longer copied to `.goat-flow/templates/`).
- **Tests** - 51 tests across unit, integration, and contract suites. Config filtering, scope coverage, quality concern coverage, cross-agent consistency.

- **CLI** - 48 files refactored, 45→0 complexity violations. `setup/`→`workflow/setup/`, `ai/`→`.goat-flow/`. Server logging (errors, host blocks, dev request log).
- **Learning Loop** - category bucket files (ADR-021). Alpine.js `:style` footgun documented. SBAO agent structure lesson (3 recurrences). Checkbox discipline lesson (3 recurrences).
- **Tests** - 275→1,166. Terminal idle timeout updated for session deletion. Tautological/dead assertions fixed. deny-dangerous.sh hardened (long-form flags, pipe-to-interpreter).
- **Structure** - `docs/skills/` with Mermaid diagrams, `.goat-flow/glossary.md`, preflight with decimal timing. Footer: "Built by BlunderGOAT · v0.10.0".
