## v0.9.4 (unreleased)

M1 Fixes & Hygiene. Driven by 6 cross-project reviews (avg 71/100) + real-project testing on blundergoat-platform and strands-php-client. Human testing gate: all sections pass.

### Scanner Honesty
- Stop faking Codex enforcement facts — `denyUsesJq`/`denyHandlesChaining` no longer hardcoded for config-based deny. New `denyIsConfigBased` flag; checks 2.2.5a/2.2.5b return N/A instead of false passes.
- Distinguish source JS from tooling JS — devDependencies-only projects no longer flagged as JavaScript
- New check 2.2.5g: flag when `Read(.env)` denied but `Edit(.env)`/`Write(.env)` not
- New AP20: detect non-canonical goat-flow skill directories (-3 deduction)
- Error messages show expected format example (`**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED`)

### Scanner Fixes (post-review, 2026-04-01)
- **Remove AP2** — harmful dead code that penalized project-specific skills (deploy/, preflight/). The associated `ap-fix-skill-names` fragment instructed agents to rename non-goat skills.
- **Fix AP14/AP20** — both used `skills.found` (canonical names only) instead of `skills.installedDirs` (actual directory listing). AP20 could never detect stale skill dirs. New `installedDirs` field on `AgentFacts.skills`.
- **Fix goat-goat setup bug** — `compose-setup.ts` derived dispatcher path as `goat-goat/SKILL.md` instead of `goat/SKILL.md`. Regression tests added.

### Upgrade Path
- Setup prompt instructs stale skill cleanup (8 old names + 3 legacy dirs), router table rewrite, dispatcher replacement
- CI template uses canonical 6 skill names (was stale: investigate, refactor, simplify)
- Ship static CI template at `workflow/templates/context-validation.yml`

### Enforcement
- Setup deny fragment includes `Edit(**/.env*)` and `Write(**/.env*)`
- `format-file.sh` fragment now wires hook into settings.json with agent dir skip pattern
- Format hook template checks formatter availability (`command -v`) before invocation

### Skills
- All 5 specialized skills check `docs/footguns.md` in Step 0 before acting (P27)
- Both installed copies and workflow templates updated
- Dispatcher template (`goat.md`): richer intent table with modes (compliance, dependency audit), Output Format section, mode-aware post-dispatch chaining

### Version Sync
- Version headers synced to v0.9.3 across system-spec, getting-started, CLAUDE.md
- All 6 workflow/skills templates synced from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3
- New `prepublishOnly` check prevents template/package version drift at publish time
- `conventions.md` Node requirement fixed: >=20.11.0 (was >=22)
- `base.instructions.md` Node version fixed: >=20.11.0 (was 20.6+), script reference fixed: `npm run scan` (was `self-scan`)
- README: scanner count corrected to 95 checks + 17 anti-patterns (was 103), skill count to 6 (was 9)

### Hooks
- `stop-lint.sh` now runs `tsc --noEmit` when `.ts` files change
- Preflight find pattern: `goat*.md` (was `goat-*.md`) to include dispatcher template

### Lessons & Footguns
- 3 new lessons: "AI gate passed" ≠ done, verification scope must not assume goat-only skills, dispatcher keeps getting excluded from glob patterns
- 2 new footguns: CI template derivation bug (goat-goat), AP2 penalizes project-specific skills (RESOLVED)

### Config File & Learning Loop (M1b)
- New `goat-flow.yaml` config file with `js-yaml` reader, validation, merge semantics, unknown-key warnings
- Monolithic `docs/footguns.md` and `docs/lessons.md` migrated to directory format with individual YAML frontmatter entry files
- Migration scripts: `splitFootguns`, `splitLessons`, `mergeFootguns`, `mergeLessons`
- Scanner reads footgun/lesson/evals/coding-standards paths from config (not hardcoded)
- Config threaded through `scan.ts` → `orchestrator.ts` → `shared.ts`
- Checks 2.3.1/2.3.3 switched from `file_exists` to `dir_exists`
- New foundation checks 1.5.5 (config exists) and 1.5.6 (config valid)
- `.goat-flow/` gitignored workspace for local footguns, lessons, tasks, and logs
- Committed vs local split: `docs/footguns/` + `ai/lessons/` (team knowledge) vs `.goat-flow/footguns/` + `.goat-flow/lessons/` (agent-local)
- CLAUDE.md LOG section updated with write-path guidance (frontmatter format, filename convention, committed vs local routing)
- Unknown agent names in config downgraded from error to warning (future-proof)
- Template vars `{evals_dir}` and `{coding_standards_dir}` added to check-evaluator

### Directory Restructure
- `docs/lessons/` → `ai/lessons/` (agent behavioral corrections belong with agent infra)
- `docs/decisions/` → `ai/decisions/` (ADRs about agent workflow)
- `agent-evals/` → `ai/evals/` (agent test infrastructure)
- `ai/instructions/` → `ai/coding-standards/` (clearer name)
- `tasks/` → `.goat-flow/tasks/` (gitignored working memory)
- `tasks/logs/` → `.goat-flow/logs/` (gitignored telemetry)
- All footgun files date-prefixed (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`)
- 248 files updated across source, tests, docs, skills (3 agent dirs), setup templates, CI

### Roadmap Plans
- M1b, M3, M5, M6, M7 deeply reviewed and improved for sub-agent executability
- M3: gamification audit phased (inventory → human judgment → implementation), project type detection heuristics, measurable quality gate thresholds
- M5: build script gap fixed, dispatcher routing corrected, CDN fallback clarified
- M6: `--prompt` flag corrected to positional arg, integration contract with serve-dashboard.ts, sub-agent phasing added
- M7: CSP `connect-src` moved to M6, Escape key replaced with Ctrl+Shift+D, session lifecycle deduped with M6

## v0.9.3 - 2026-03-30

Skill consolidation, scanner improvements, enforcement hardening. Driven by cross-project reviews from halaxy-cypress (66), blundergoat-platform (74), healthkit (68). Rubric v0.9.3: 101 checks + 17 anti-patterns. 216 tests.

### Skills (9 → 6)
- goat-investigate merged into goat-debug (investigate/onboard modes)
- goat-simplify merged into goat-review (simplify mode)
- goat-refactor merged into goat-plan (refactor planning mode)
- goat-security expanded with compliance and dependency audit modes
- goat dispatcher added to SKILL_NAMES as 6th canonical skill
- All 6 skills synced identically across .claude/, .agents/, .github/. 1,790 → 1,067 lines.

### Scanner
- Format diagnostics when footguns/lessons have content but 0 entries parse
- AP deductions shown in default text output, not just verbose mode
- Eval coverage gap lists missing skill names instead of just count
- CI check patterns hardened from keyword presence to invocation matching
- AP18: unanswered ADAPT comments in skills. AP19: hardcoded absolute paths in hooks
- Fabrication detection: file:line refs validated for line-number range

### Enforcement
- `Edit(**/.env*)` and `Write(**/.env*)` deny alongside existing `Read(**/.env*)`
- Format hook skips agent config dirs by default
- guard-write-size.sh: complete script template with registration JSON
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` bypass vectors documented
- stop-lint.sh: performance tuning guidance for heavy linters

### Setup & Dispatcher
- Migration fragments include router table + CI sync after skill changes
- Python stack detection: subdirectory-only Python no longer overrides root commands
- Ask First checklist: short form (2 questions) or full form (5 items)
- Dispatcher: analysis verb disambiguation, target-aware routing, post-dispatch chaining

---

## v0.9.2 - 2026-03-30

Post-publish fixes. README restructured as dashboard-first. npm package description updated.

- README: Install + Dashboard sections lead, setup instructions near top, CLI consolidated into reference block
- Dashboard: removed auto-open browser (just prints URL), removed unused `exec` import
- Setup prompt: Phase 1b wording fixed - "9 skills (8 goat-* + /goat dispatcher)" instead of "9 goat-*"
- package.json description updated to mention dashboard

---

## v0.9.1 - 2026-03-30

Dashboard, full coding-standards wiring, skill conversation enforcement, npm publish. Rubric v0.9.1: 103 checks + 16 anti-patterns. 191 tests.

### Dashboard
- `goat-flow dashboard` - local server with live scanning, 4 tabs (Overview, Checks, Compare, Fixes)
- `--format html` for standalone HTML reports, `--format markdown` for PR comments
- Dark mode, responsive mobile, keyboard navigation, ARIA accessibility
- Dashboard source at `src/dashboard/`, Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS v4 via CDN

### Coding Standards - Full Wiring
- All 57 templates routed by CLI (was 25). New: `backend/python.md`, `devops/packer.md`
- Framework detection: Laravel, Symfony, Django, FastAPI, Rails, Spring, Express, Cypress
- Stack detectors fleshed out: Ruby (Gemfile), Java (pom.xml/build.gradle), C# (.csproj/.sln)
- 9 security framework templates, 6 security topics, 2 devops templates auto-routed by signals
- 21 new fragment map entries for targeted-fix mode

### Skills
- All 9 skills (8 goat-* + dispatcher) synced from canonical templates across 3 agent dirs (27 files)
- Step 0 adaptive gate on every skill - agents must confirm context before entering Phase 1
- Scanner requires 100% conversational compliance (was 80%), structural detection replaces keyword matching
- Restored missing features: goat-review audit mode, goat-debug onboard mode, goat-debug hypothesis rules

### Scanner
- Removed check 2.2.5g (package mutation deny) - agents should install packages freely
- Dispatcher is 9th canonical skill for eval diversity counting (ADR-016)
- XSS fix in HTML injection, CORS wildcard removed, agent param validation added

### npm Publish
- Published as `@blundergoat/goat-flow`. 197 files, 300KB packed

---

## v0.9.0 - 2026-03-29

Dispatcher skill, coding-standards refresh, scanner hardening, telemetry, signal-aware setup. Rubric v0.9.0: 104 checks + 16 anti-patterns. 167 tests.

### Coding Standards (Phases 1-8)
- Backend: go.md interface fix, DRF split, Rust/Spring/.NET/TS Node detection; frontend: 9-framework routing, version gates
- Security: new `llm-security.md`, `phi-compliance.md`, `framework-specific/go.md`, `framework-specific/symfony.md`; expanded web-common/api-auth/supply-chain/infrastructure/file-upload
- DevOps: new `devops/` with `terraform.md`, `packer.md`; `code-review.md` Learning Loop Cross-Check

### Scanner
- Checks 2.1.20-21: dispatcher skill + Shared Conventions block
- AP16: deprecated skills (-5); AP17: dangling skill refs (-3)
- 2.2.5g-h: package mutation + cloud-destructive deny blocking
- 2.7.1-3: signal follow-through (LLM, PHI hot path, formatter gaps)
- 3.1.7: eval frontmatter enforcement; 3.3.4: loop consistency promoted to standard (3 pts)
- 3.1.6: eval coverage rebalanced (2 pts, partial at 4/8); 3.1.3 reduced to 1 pt

### Signal-Aware Setup & Telemetry
- `mapSignalsToTemplates()` auto-routes `phi-compliance.md` + `llm-security.md` on signal detection
- `renderSignals()` produces actionable tasks; formatter gap detection checks hook content
- `scan-logger.ts` auto-appends per-agent JSONL; skills/loop reference telemetry

### Skills, Hooks & Version Consistency
- Dispatcher skill + Shared Conventions across all agent dirs; 9 skill-specific evals (YAML frontmatter)
- Preflight: instruction headers, installed skills, workflow templates, dual-agent loop consistency
- `.claude/hooks/format-file.sh` (prettier); deny hooks: package + cloud blocks

---

## v0.8.0 - 2026-03-28

Skill model cleanup (10→8 enforced), setup prompt bug fix, documentation alignment, rubric scoring cleanup. Rubric v0.8.0: 97 checks + 15 anti-patterns. 138 tests.

### Rubric Scoring Cleanup
- Converted previously advisory checks into scored checks where the detector is reliable: footgun evidence labels, lesson path validity, router completeness for learning loop/architecture/evals, eval Agents labels, handoff template required sections, and eval skill diversity
- Removed zero-point checks that were too heuristic or too weak to score safely: skill Step 0 adaptation, Ask First boundary/router overlap, AI ignore files, and cold-path line budget
- Moved empty `docs/decisions/` from a zero-point rubric check to anti-pattern `AP16` with a small deduction, so misleading empty ADR scaffolding now affects score
- Tightened `3.3.1a` to require all five handoff template sections before awarding the point
- Total check count remains 97 after the cleanup; anti-pattern count increases to 15

### Skill Consolidation (10→8) - ADR-007
- goat-reflect/audit merged into goat-review (Instruction Review + Audit modes), goat-onboard merged into goat-debug (Onboard mode), goat-context removed
- goat-investigate merged into goat-debug (Investigate mode), goat-simplify merged into goat-review (Simplify mode), goat-refactor merged into goat-plan (Refactor Planning mode)
- Deprecated skill dirs deleted from .claude/, .agents/, .github/ - all three now have identical 8-skill parity
- `goat-flow-skill-version: "0.7.0"` frontmatter on all installed skills; DEPRECATED_SKILL_NAMES constant provides scanner migration grace period

### Setup Prompt Fix
- Skill-quality recommendation keys (add-skill-step0, add-skill-human-gates, etc.) were all resolving to "Adapt from goat-debug.md" - FRAGMENT_TEMPLATE_MAP pointed them at goat-debug as an example reference
- renderShortFix now skips template paths for `add-skill-*` and `create-all-skills` keys, renders actual instruction text instead
- `--agent all` removed (exit 2 with per-agent message)
- Language mapper expanded to 10 languages (+Java, Ruby, C#)

### Documentation Alignment
- 21 stale "10 skills" references fixed across README.md, docs/ (getting-started, architecture, five-layers, cross-agent-comparison, examples), setup/ (README, phase-1, execution-loop, setup-codex), src/cli/ (standard.ts, compose-setup.ts, full.ts)
- docs/system-spec.md deprecated skill descriptions (goat-reflect, goat-onboard, goat-resume) updated; goat-investigate/goat-simplify/goat-refactor merged into modes
- docs/system/five-layers.md skill table trimmed from 10 to 8 rows; workflow/README.md skill list updated
- CHANGELOG.md and README.md scanner counts corrected (92→97 checks, 12→14 anti-patterns)
- Rubric comment at standard.ts:18 corrected (19 pts/10 existence → 17 pts/8 existence)

### CI Template Fix
- `full.ts:126` shell for-loop was generating CI YAML checking deprecated skills (audit, reflect, onboard, resume)
- Fixed to check the canonical 8: security, debug, investigate, review, plan, test, refactor, simplify

### Tests
- scan-fixtures.test.ts full-pass fixture updated from 9 deprecated skills (included audit, context) to canonical 8
- 138 tests pass (was 96)

### ADRs
- ADR-007: skill consolidation 10→8 - justification test, merge mapping, consequences
- ADR-008: reference-based setup prompts - why inline skeletons failed (template drift, agent copy-paste, context waste)

### Cross-Project Audit (9 projects)
- All 9 projects score A (96-100%) after v0.8.0 changes
- Setup files regenerated with fixed CLI for all projects
- Per-project review prompts generated in tasks/cli-setup-claude/

---

## v0.7.0 - 2026-03-26

Reference-based setup prompts, scanner accuracy fixes, CLI simplification. Setup output drops from ~860 to ~90 lines. Rubric v0.7.0: 92 checks + 12 anti-patterns.

### Reference-Based Setup Prompt
- Setup generates ~90-line prompts with template path tables instead of ~860 lines of inline skeletons
- Agent-branched tables (Claude/Codex/Gemini), language-to-coding-standards mapper, `--agent all` with interactive picker
- Skill quality requirements block in Phase 1b, `GOAT_FLOW_INLINE_SETUP=1` rollback, `setup/` + `workflow/` in npm tarball

### Scanner Accuracy (rubric v0.7.0)
- 3.3.4 sync: Jaccard word-intersection ≥0.85 (was length-ratio ≥0.6), matches bold format
- 2.3.2 lessons.md: strips HTML comments, requires 20+ chars of real content after H3
- AP11: fires when EITHER lessons OR footguns is empty (was AND)
- Check 2.2.7 removed - ask-first-guard hooks removed from all agents (ADR-006)

### Template Quality
- enforcement.md: jq parsing guidance, sed fallback, command chaining, read-deny patterns
- docs-seed.md: concrete `git log`/`grep -rn` commands for seeding real incidents
- execution-loop.md: "logs updated if tripped" DoD gate added

### Removed
- `fix` and `audit` CLI commands (deprecated in v0.6.0, now exit 2 with migration message)
- ask-first-guard.sh hooks and scanner check 2.2.7 - see ADR-006

### Other
- GitHub Actions: goat-flow-scan.yml permissions, setup-node version bump
- AGENTS.md trimmed to 113 lines, execution loops synced verbatim across all 3 agents
- New: src/cli/paths.ts, src/cli/prompt/template-refs.ts; 96 tests (was 77)

- 4 new checks: Ask First enforcement (2.2.7), lessons depth (2.3.2a), footgun file refs (2.3.5), cross-agent loop consistency (3.3.4)
- 3 new anti-patterns: AP10 settings.local bloat, AP11 empty learning loop, AP12 stale footgun refs
- Confidence-weighted scoring (medium/low checks at 50%), rebalanced weights, removed dead checks
- Deny hook security audit: blocking logic, jq parsing, command chaining, rm-rf, force push, chmod 777
- Audited projects drop from 100% to 92-99% - scanner now catches real quality gaps

### Skills & Coding Standards
- 10 skills (+goat-onboard, goat-reflect, goat-resume), deployed to all 3 agent dirs
- 49 coding standards templates: backend (13), frontend (14), security (12), plus shared
- Eval runner: `goat-flow eval` with YAML frontmatter parser, text/JSON output

### TypeScript & CLI Quality
- 0 ESLint warnings, 0 knip unused exports, 0 non-null assertions
- 6 god functions split to ≤15 cyclomatic complexity, CLIError replaces process.exit()
- JSDoc on all 35 src/cli/ files, strict tsconfig (noUncheckedIndexedAccess, ES2023)
