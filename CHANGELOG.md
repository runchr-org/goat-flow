## v0.9.1 - 2026-03-30

HTML dashboard, CLI enhancements, skill conversation enforcement, coding-standards refresh, scanner hardening, telemetry, signal-aware setup. Rubric v0.9.1: 104 checks + 16 anti-patterns. 167 tests.

### Dashboard
- `goat-flow dashboard .` - local server with live scanning, auto-opens browser
- `goat-flow scan . --format html` - self-contained offline HTML report
- 4 tabs: Overview, Checks (drill-down with filters), Compare (multi-agent diff), Fixes (recommendation browser with copy/download)
- Folder browser, dark mode, responsive mobile, keyboard navigation, ARIA accessibility

### Skills - Conversation Enforcement (M06)
- All 9 skills synced from canonical templates across all 3 agent directories (27 files)
- Step 0 contradiction fixed: Shared Conventions said "adaptive" but Step 0 body said "hard block" - resolved by syncing from templates which use the Adaptive Step 0 pattern consistently
- Explicit "Before proceeding" gate added to every skill's Step 0 section - agents must present context and wait for confirmation before entering Phase 1
- Stale goat-audit reference removed from goat-review (goat-audit was merged into goat-review in v0.8.0)
- Missing Flush protocol added to goat-refactor and goat-simplify deployed copies
- goat-investigate: onboard mode restored (was missing from deployed copy)
- goat-debug: hypothesis 2-category rule, confidence floor, CAN'T REPRODUCE protocol restored
- goat-security: framework tables, dependency audit commands, attack scenario format restored
- Scanner check 2.1.16 tightened: requires all skills to be conversational (was 80% threshold)
- Scanner heuristic now requires structural indicators (BLOCKING GATE/HUMAN GATE + choices/Offer/Proceed) instead of keyword matching

### Coding Standards - Full Wiring
- All 55 coding-standards templates now routed by CLI (was 25 of 55)
- Backend framework detection: Laravel, Symfony, Django, FastAPI, Rails, Spring, Express
- Stack detectors fleshed out: Ruby (Gemfile), Java (pom.xml/build.gradle), C# (.csproj/.sln)
- Security framework-specific routing: 9 templates auto-selected per detected framework
- Signal-driven security topics: api-auth, file-upload, sql-injection (web), infrastructure (deploy platforms), secrets-management, supply-chain (always)
- DevOps routing: Terraform + Packer templates via deploy platform signals
- Always-on templates: security.md, testing.md, copilot-bridge.md, domain-instructions.md
- 21 new fragment map entries for targeted-fix mode

### CLI
- `--format html` and `--format markdown` output modes
- `--output <file>` flag for writing to file
- npm scripts: scan, scan:verbose, scan:json, setup, dashboard, preflight, validate
- Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS v4 via CDN (jsdelivr, version-pinned)

## v0.9.0 - 2026-03-29

Dispatcher skill, coding-standards refresh, scanner hardening, telemetry, signal-aware setup. Rubric v0.9.0: 104 checks + 16 anti-patterns. 167 tests.

### Coding Standards (Phases 1-8)
- Backend: go.md interface fix, DRF split, Rust/Spring/.NET/TS Node detection; frontend: 9-framework routing, version gates
- Security: new `llm-security.md`, `phi-compliance.md`, `framework-specific/go.md`, `framework-specific/symfony.md`; expanded web-common/api-auth/supply-chain/infrastructure/file-upload
- DevOps: new `devops/` with `terraform.md`, `packer.md`; `code-review.md` Learning Loop Cross-Check

### Scanner
- Checks 2.1.20-21: dispatcher skill + Shared Conventions block
- AP16: deprecated skills (-5); AP17: dangling skill refs (-3)
- 2.2.5g-h: package mutation + cloud-destructive deny blocking
- 2.7.1-3: signal follow-through (LLM, PHI hot path, formatter gaps)
- 3.1.7: eval frontmatter enforcement; 3.3.4: loop consistency promoted to standard (3 pts)
- 3.1.6: eval coverage rebalanced (2 pts, partial at 4/8); 3.1.3 reduced to 1 pt

### Signal-Aware Setup & Telemetry
- `mapSignalsToTemplates()` auto-routes `phi-compliance.md` + `llm-security.md` on signal detection
- `renderSignals()` produces actionable tasks; formatter gap detection checks hook content
- `scan-logger.ts` auto-appends per-agent JSONL; skills/loop reference telemetry

### Skills, Hooks & Version Consistency
- Dispatcher skill + Shared Conventions across all agent dirs; 9 skill-specific evals (YAML frontmatter)
- Preflight: instruction headers, installed skills, workflow templates, dual-agent loop consistency
- `.claude/hooks/format-file.sh` (prettier); deny hooks: package + cloud blocks

## v0.8.0 - 2026-03-28

Skill model cleanup (10→8 enforced), setup prompt bug fix, documentation alignment, rubric scoring cleanup. Rubric v0.8.0: 97 checks + 15 anti-patterns. 138 tests.

### Rubric Scoring Cleanup
- Converted previously advisory checks into scored checks where the detector is reliable: footgun evidence labels, lesson path validity, router completeness for learning loop/architecture/evals, eval Agents labels, handoff template required sections, and eval skill diversity
- Removed zero-point checks that were too heuristic or too weak to score safely: skill Step 0 adaptation, Ask First boundary/router overlap, AI ignore files, and cold-path line budget
- Moved empty `docs/decisions/` from a zero-point rubric check to anti-pattern `AP16` with a small deduction, so misleading empty ADR scaffolding now affects score
- Tightened `3.3.1a` to require all five handoff template sections before awarding the point
- Total check count remains 97 after the cleanup; anti-pattern count increases to 15

### Skill Consolidation (10→8) - ADR-007
- goat-reflect/audit merged into goat-review (Instruction Review + Audit modes), goat-onboard merged into goat-investigate (Onboard mode), goat-context removed
- goat-refactor (cross-file renames, blast radius analysis) and goat-simplify (readability, no behaviour change) added as new skills
- Deprecated skill dirs deleted from .claude/, .agents/, .github/ - all three now have identical 8-skill parity
- `goat-flow-skill-version: "0.7.0"` frontmatter on all installed skills; DEPRECATED_SKILL_NAMES constant provides scanner migration grace period

### Setup Prompt Fix
- Skill-quality recommendation keys (add-skill-step0, add-skill-human-gates, etc.) were all resolving to "Adapt from goat-debug.md" - FRAGMENT_TEMPLATE_MAP pointed them at goat-debug as an example reference
- renderShortFix now skips template paths for `add-skill-*` and `create-all-skills` keys, renders actual instruction text instead
- `--agent all` removed (exit 2 with per-agent message)
- Language mapper expanded to 10 languages (+Java, Ruby, C#)

### Documentation Alignment
- 21 stale "10 skills" references fixed across README.md, docs/ (getting-started, architecture, five-layers, cross-agent-comparison, examples), setup/ (README, phase-1, execution-loop, setup-codex), src/cli/ (standard.ts, compose-setup.ts, full.ts)
- docs/system-spec.md deprecated skill descriptions (goat-reflect, goat-onboard, goat-resume) replaced with goat-refactor/goat-simplify
- docs/system/five-layers.md skill table trimmed from 10 to 8 rows; workflow/README.md skill list updated
- CHANGELOG.md and README.md scanner counts corrected (92→97 checks, 12→14 anti-patterns)
- Rubric comment at standard.ts:18 corrected (19 pts/10 existence → 17 pts/8 existence)

### CI Template Fix
- `full.ts:126` shell for-loop was generating CI YAML checking deprecated skills (audit, reflect, onboard, resume)
- Fixed to check the canonical 8: security, debug, investigate, review, plan, test, refactor, simplify

### Tests
- scan-fixtures.test.ts full-pass fixture updated from 9 deprecated skills (included audit, context) to canonical 8
- 138 tests pass (was 96)

### ADRs
- ADR-007: skill consolidation 10→8 - justification test, merge mapping, consequences
- ADR-008: reference-based setup prompts - why inline skeletons failed (template drift, agent copy-paste, context waste)

### Cross-Project Audit (9 projects)
- All 9 projects score A (96-100%) after v0.8.0 changes
- Setup files regenerated with fixed CLI for all projects
- Per-project review prompts generated in tasks/cli-setup-claude/

---

## v0.7.0 - 2026-03-26

Reference-based setup prompts, scanner accuracy fixes, CLI simplification. Setup output drops from ~860 to ~90 lines. Rubric v0.7.0: 92 checks + 12 anti-patterns.

### Reference-Based Setup Prompt
- Setup generates ~90-line prompts with template path tables instead of ~860 lines of inline skeletons
- Agent-branched tables (Claude/Codex/Gemini), language-to-coding-standards mapper, `--agent all` with interactive picker
- Skill quality requirements block in Phase 1b, `GOAT_FLOW_INLINE_SETUP=1` rollback, `setup/` + `workflow/` in npm tarball

### Scanner Accuracy (rubric v0.7.0)
- 3.3.4 sync: Jaccard word-intersection ≥0.85 (was length-ratio ≥0.6), matches bold format
- 2.3.2 lessons.md: strips HTML comments, requires 20+ chars of real content after H3
- AP11: fires when EITHER lessons OR footguns is empty (was AND)
- Check 2.2.7 removed - ask-first-guard hooks removed from all agents (ADR-006)

### Template Quality
- enforcement.md: jq parsing guidance, sed fallback, command chaining, read-deny patterns
- docs-seed.md: concrete `git log`/`grep -rn` commands for seeding real incidents
- execution-loop.md: "logs updated if tripped" DoD gate added

### Removed
- `fix` and `audit` CLI commands (deprecated in v0.6.0, now exit 2 with migration message)
- ask-first-guard.sh hooks and scanner check 2.2.7 - see ADR-006

### Other
- GitHub Actions: goat-flow-scan.yml permissions, setup-node version bump
- AGENTS.md trimmed to 113 lines, execution loops synced verbatim across all 3 agents
- New: src/cli/paths.ts, src/cli/prompt/template-refs.ts; 96 tests (was 77)

- 4 new checks: Ask First enforcement (2.2.7), lessons depth (2.3.2a), footgun file refs (2.3.5), cross-agent loop consistency (3.3.4)
- 3 new anti-patterns: AP10 settings.local bloat, AP11 empty learning loop, AP12 stale footgun refs
- Confidence-weighted scoring (medium/low checks at 50%), rebalanced weights, removed dead checks
- Deny hook security audit: blocking logic, jq parsing, command chaining, rm-rf, force push, chmod 777
- Audited projects drop from 100% to 92-99% - scanner now catches real quality gaps

### Skills & Coding Standards
- 10 skills (+goat-onboard, goat-reflect, goat-resume), deployed to all 3 agent dirs
- 49 coding standards templates: backend (13), frontend (14), security (12), plus shared
