# Changelog

## v1.3.0 - 2026-04-27

Plan completion protocol, browser-use shared reference, hook/push enforcement, dashboard prompt/quality upgrades, instruction artifact routing, harness-score honesty, performance/reference-version improvements, harness docs, and README rewrite.

- **Browser-use shared reference** - Browser-use guidance moved out of per-skill `goat-debug/references/` copies into the shared skill-reference surface (`workflow/skills/reference/browser-use.md` and `.goat-flow/skill-reference/browser-use.md`). Manifest, install, drift, preflight, quality, and preamble checks now treat browser-use as shared UI-evidence doctrine, and goat-debug offers installation guidance when browser-use is unavailable instead of silently falling back.
- **Agent push and deny guardrails** - ADR-025 blocks all agent-initiated `git push` operations, with README, Help, landing, harness, hook, and settings surfaces aligned to the all-push policy. Deny hooks also gained command-parsing fixes, aggregate audit-scope support, deny-hook path mismatch reporting, and broader Claude settings denies for destructive commands plus secret/credential read/write/edit tools.
- **Quality and skill protocol integrity** - The dashboard quality mode formerly named "Agent Setup Quality" is now "Agent Installation" with cleaner scoring-axis copy. goat-critique invocation, delegation-consent, and interruption-freeze wording was tightened across skill and instruction surfaces, with preflight/contract coverage preventing agent-specific delegation exceptions in shared skill files.
- **Reference version auditability** - Shared skill references, goat-security per-skill reference packs, and reference fixtures now carry `goat-flow-reference-version` frontmatter. `bump-version.sh`, `check-versions.mjs`, preflight, quality prompts, and contract tests update or verify reference docs alongside `SKILL.md` frontmatter so upgrades are easier to audit.
- **Harness engineering and site docs** - Added the standalone harness engineering site page with structured data, SEO metadata, and OG imagery. Landing assets were moved under `docs/site/`, footer/redundant-link copy was cleaned up, and Help/README copy now reflects current push enforcement.
- **Audit, dashboard, and learning-loop fixes** - Agent-scoped audit validation now accepts aggregate checks, dashboard review status accounts for invalid line references, agent provenance and quality no-write wording were corrected, and new learning-loop entries document browser tooling checks plus the quick/lite goat-critique quality-assessor trap.
- **goat-debug browser evidence** - `/goat-debug` now detects UI bugs at Step 0 and uses the shared browser-use reference on-demand for browser-based evidence capture. D1 gains browser evidence for hypothesis testing (after initial read and hypothesis generation), D4 gains browser-based post-fix verification. Reference file covers availability check, D1/D4 workflows, command reference, security cautions, and a manual fallback when browser-use is unavailable. Registered in `workflow/manifest.json` for durable drift protection via `check-drift.ts`. All four skill surfaces synced. New "Debug UI in Browser" dashboard preset.
- **Audit batch optimization** - `runAuditBatch()` shares config, structure, and provenance across aggregate and per-agent audit passes, eliminating the N+1 pattern where each per-agent audit re-parsed config and facts independently. Dashboard route handler updated to use the batch API.
- **Dashboard learning-loop resilience** - Home view learning-loop summary handles missing `footgunCount`/`lessonCount` gracefully, falling back to `recordCount` display.
- **Performance** - Request-scoped read cache in `createFS` (`src/cli/facts/fs.ts`): `readFile`, `readJson`, `lineCount`, `exists`, and `listDir` cache results per FS instance, eliminating redundant disk reads across the N+1 audit pattern. `findLatestQualityReport` scans filenames newest-first and stops at the first valid match instead of parsing all history files. Agent detection (`/api/agents/installed`) cached in the dashboard route handler closure with `?fresh=true` escape hatch. Dashboard enrichment (learning-loop summary + recent lessons) cached with 60s TTL. `writeAuditCache` switched from synchronous `writeFileSync` to async fire-and-forget `writeFile`. `validateRegisteredCheckProvenance` cached per-process since registered checks are static module data.
- **Quality CLI `--mode` flag** - `goat-flow quality . --agent <id> --mode <mode>` for mode-specific quality prompts. `quality history --mode <mode>` and `quality diff --mode <mode>` filter to one quality mode. History deltas now compare within the same mode only. Dashboard quality launcher wired to the same mode filters.
- **Learning-loop `sizeBytes`** - `sizeBytes` property added to bucket stats facts. `goat-flow stats --check` now warns when any footgun or lesson bucket exceeds 40KB, surfacing oversized buckets before they degrade agent context quality.
- **goat-plan Phase 4 - Plan Complete** - New formal completion protocol requiring both an AI verification gate (every milestone complete, every task ticked, every exit criterion evidenced, every testing gate passed with proof from the current session, every assumption validated) and a blocking human verification gate (agent presents all files changed, all milestones, and evidence for each exit criterion, then waits for explicit approval). Agents MUST NOT include self-destruct instructions in plan artifacts or delete/archive plan files without human approval. Plan Completion Protocol also added to `skill-conventions.md` as shared doctrine.
- **Skill hardening** - `/goat-plan` now includes a mid-implementation proof checkpoint for long coding work. `/goat-review` no longer assumes `origin/main`: it prefers PR metadata, explicit base, remote default branch discovery, then a recorded last-resort fallback. `/goat-review` also separates reporting-only review DoD from implementation DoD. `/goat-qa` Standard mode now includes Verification Integrity in the first gap-analysis output. `/goat-critique` now checks sub-agent output completeness before trusting self-report. Deployment quality guidance clarifies when "bulletproof" evidence is a release gate versus hardening debt.
- **Hook version comparison audit** - New `checkHookVersion` in `check-agent-setup.ts` compares each installed `deny-dangerous.sh` against the canonical `workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh` template. Mismatches fail the audit with a fix command pointing at the correct `setup --agent` invocation. `goat-flow-hook-version` header added to hook files for traceability.
- **Hook drift detection** - `check-drift.ts` now compares hook files (not just skills and shared docs). Reads agent hook paths from `manifest.json` and compares against `workflow/hooks/` templates. Missing or divergent hooks surface as drift findings.
- **Deny hook hardening** - No-space redirect detection: `echo foo>.env`, `echo foo>>.env`, `echo foo>|.env` now blocked (previously only space-separated redirects were caught). `.env.example` redirect writes also blocked. Escaped `.env`/`.env.example` regex dots to prevent false positives on near-miss filenames (`aenv`, `xenv.local`, `aenv.example`). `npm token delete/revoke` blocked as irreversible credential destruction. Self-test expanded with no-space redirect cases, false-positive near-miss probes, and npm token management cases.
- **bump-version.sh** - Now syncs hook templates to all installed mirrors (reads hook paths from manifest) and updates hook version headers alongside skill frontmatter.
- **Dashboard custom prompts** - New browser-local custom prompt library with create/edit/delete, prompt metadata, favorites, global-safety gating, custom-to-preset launch integration, and dedicated unit coverage.
- **Dashboard Quality page** - Adds mode-specific quality prompts for GOAT Flow Process, Agent Installation, Harness Engineering, and Skills. Non-API modes now include the same `.goat-flow/logs/quality/<timestamp>-<agent>-<rand>.json` persistence and validation contract as the agent setup prompt. Quality-mode prompts are hidden from normal preset browsing even when internal presets are shown.
- **Quality report contract** - `quality validate` now enforces current report provenance (`scope`, `rubric_version`, `quality_mode`, and per-finding `evidence_method`) while `quality history` still loads legacy logs. Dashboard quality prompts use the injected package version instead of hardcoded release strings, and quality prompts clarify that live findings may cite `file:line` while durable footguns/lessons/patterns/decisions must use semantic anchors.
- **Dashboard Prompts page** - Preset catalog now carries richer metadata for route, source, global safety, internal-only, quality mode, prerequisites, write risk, artifact requirements, target surfaces, fallback prompt, and cost tier, with dry-run launch tests across runners.
- **Dashboard Home and Workspace** - Cached audit age now switches from minutes to hours and days, and dashboard terminal/session handling was tightened for project switching, target-path context, and launch labels.
- **Harness scoring honesty** - Feedback-loop harness checks now fail on stale footgun/lesson file references instead of treating them as informational. Recovery harness now reports checkbox progress as informational local working-state context rather than treating unchecked gitignored milestones as a quality failure.
- **Recovery and workspace-boundary prompts** - Setup verification docs no longer refer to removed compaction-hook recovery machinery. Harness Engineering prompts now treat Workspace Boundary as a qualitative cross-cutting risk instead of asking agents to score it as a deterministic harness concern.
- **Instruction artifact routing** - `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, Copilot instructions, setup templates, and shared skill preamble now route "add a footgun/lesson/decision/pattern" requests to documentation artifacts instead of runtime code. README guidance was added to footgun and lesson buckets.
- **README rewrite** - Dashboard-first positioning. View-by-view descriptions (Home, Setup, Prompts, Workspace, Projects, Quality) replace the previous execution-loop-first framing. Updated "Getting Started" and feature comparison table.
- **Learning loop** - New verification lessons for deny-dangerous no-space redirect/false-positive probes and preflight-as-release-gate failures. New skill footguns cover portable PR base selection and shared-reference template/install drift. Stale local-path evidence was rewritten so `stats --check` stays green.

## v1.2.5 - 2026-04-24

CLI silently exited without running when invoked through a symlink - which is every `npx goat-flow`, `./node_modules/.bin/goat-flow`, and npm `scripts` invocation. Fixed the main-module guard and added a regression test.

- **fix: CLI no-op via symlink** - The ESM main-module guard compared `resolve(process.argv[1])` against `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`. `path.resolve()` does not follow symlinks, but Node's ESM loader resolves symlinks for `import.meta.url` by default. When the CLI was launched through the `node_modules/.bin/goat-flow` symlink (the standard npm/npx path), the two sides never matched, `main()` never ran, and the process exited 0 with zero output. The fix wraps both sides in `fs.realpathSync()` via an `isMainModule()` helper, with a try/catch for synthetic `argv[1]` values. Introduced in 918ca3e (v1.2.4).
- **regression test** - `test/integration/main-guard.test.ts` creates a temp-dir symlink to `dist/cli/cli.js` and verifies `--version` produces output through both the symlink and the real path. This is the exact invocation path that broke.
- **footgun** - New `.goat-flow/footguns/cli.md`: "ESM main-module guard breaks under symlinks" documents the structural trap and prevention rules.
- **lesson** - `.goat-flow/lessons/verification.md`: "Test suite must exercise the published invocation path" - all 359 tests passed while the CLI was broken for every real consumer, because no test went through the `.bin/` symlink.

## v1.2.4 - 2026-04-23

Quality report fixes, node-pty as optional dependency, configurable terminal timeout, dashboard settings/export, QA prompt improvements, preset prompt library expansion, ADR-024 semantic anchors, manifest snapshot backfill, and lesson line-ref validation.

- **node-pty optional** - Moved from `dependencies` to `optionalDependencies`. Install no longer fails on Linux/WSL without C++ build tools. Dashboard terminal banner now shows platform-specific install guidance.
- **Terminal timeout** - Configurable idle timeout via `config.yaml` `terminal.idle-timeout` (default 8 hours, was hardcoded 60 min). `0` disables auto-kill. Dashboard settings view shows current value.
- **Session export** - Export button on workspace sessions downloads terminal output as `.txt`.
- **Deny hook fix** - Quoted literal backticks (e.g. `printf 'use \` here'`) no longer trigger false-positive command-substitution blocks.
- **Content quality audit** - Setup templates excluded from legacy execution-loop detection. ADR-021/022/023 added to target list and decisions README.
- **Instruction file retrieval** - All four agent instruction files now include `.goat-flow/decisions/` in retrieval for architecture/policy/setup tasks.
- **goat-qa skill** - Standard mode output template split into Phase 2 (gap analysis, presented at gate) and Phase 3 (testing plan, gated by approval). Step 0 retrieval now includes patterns.md and decisions.
- **Preset prompts** - 23 to 28 presets. Five new: Critique a Plan, Critique an Artifact, Pressure-Test a Skill, Mermaid Flow Diagram, Test Plan vs Code Changes. Existing presets sharpened with change-type-first probing, tester-voice, output format hints, and security lenses.
- **docs/skills.md** - Planning Route corrected (File-Write default at Standard+). goat-critique sub-agent count corrected to 3. goat-qa Standard trigger clarified.
- **ADR-024: Semantic anchors over line numbers** - Line numbers banned from footgun/lesson evidence. All entries migrated to grep-friendly `(search: "pattern")` anchors. Instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, copilot-instructions.md) and evaluation templates updated. `stats --check` validates search anchors against file content, catching stale evidence that line-number validation never could. Propagation sweep: `compose-quality.ts` quality prompt, `harness-quality.md`, `harness-audit.md`, setup templates (footguns-readme, 05-customise, 06-final-verification), `skill-conventions.md` entry templates, `glossary.md`, `architecture.md`, `code-map.md`, `README.md`, `goat-flow-landing.html`, and `help.html` all updated. Live-work contexts (skill-preamble, execution-loop VERIFY, adversarial-framing, review/debug/security/critique skills) correctly retain `file:line` for fresh code citation. Glossary Evidence Standard entry updated to describe both modes.
- **Manifest snapshot backfill** - Frozen v1.2.0–v1.2.4 snapshots added to `workflow/manifest-snapshots/`. Snapshot test expanded from single-version to all-release coverage (v1.1.0–v1.2.4). README updated with version table.
- **Lesson line-ref validation** - `invalidLineRefs` added to lesson facts in `stats --check` (was footguns-only). Lessons with out-of-bounds `file:line` refs now surface in health checks.
- **Decisions directory** - `.gitkeep` replaced with `README.md` containing ADR writing guidance. Installer copies the template; manifest and audit check updated for the new anchor file.
- **Quality prompt hardening** - `compose-quality.ts` adds a CRITICAL write-verification step: agents must `ls` the output file after writing to confirm it persists. `docs/audit-and-quality.md` corrected from "runs 7 skill invocations" to file-analysis-preferred approach.
- **Content-drift Round 3** - 3 findings from independent Copilot quality reports resolved: `docs/skills.md` /goat-plan summary, quality assessment invocation language, and architecture hot-path listing now includes `copilot-instructions.md`.
- **Learning loop** - 3 new lessons: fresh-eyes critique leak-scan citation format, line-number evidence debt (ADR-024 origin), snapshot fixture metadata beyond typed contract. 5 bucket files reviewed (2026-04-24).
- **Ask First boundary** - `.goat-flow/skill-reference/` added to CLAUDE.md Ask First boundaries. Shared doctrine loaded by every skill now requires approval before edits.
- **Presenting Findings format** - `skill-conventions.md` gains a "Presenting Findings" section standardising summary/problem/solution one-liner format for tasks, findings, and recommendations.
- **GEMINI.md cleanup** - Removed stale `.github/instructions/` from local-instruction checklist. Footgun evidence guidance updated to semantic anchors.

## v1.2.3 - 2026-04-22

`.env.example` read-only handling, richer dashboard presets, dashboard audit caching, reporting-only quality prompts, active-plan local-state handling, goat-critique contract tightening, terminal fixes, prompt-label tracking, deployment scripts, prompt-loading polish, shared-reference doc cleanup, widened dashboard lint coverage, and goat-qa gate clarification. 19 commits, 92 files changed, 2,584 insertions, 708 deletions.

- **Secret-file guardrails** - `.env.example` allowed for read-only inspection; real `.env`/`.env.*` and other secret paths stay blocked. All `deny-dangerous.sh` copies, agent settings, and ignore files updated with self-tests for the distinction.
- **Dashboard** - Richer preset prompts with explicit scope/evidence/handoff framing. Audit caching for packaged installs (keyed by version, `fresh=true` bypass). Dedicated loading states for setup/quality. Prompt labels now carry the runner name so terminal sessions show which agent launched them.
- **Terminal fixes** - Per-runner prompt flag (`-i`) for Copilot/Gemini sessions. Fixed duplicate paste from browser default handler firing alongside xterm clipboard write.
- **Landing page and deployment** - Standalone product page (`docs/goat-flow-landing.html`). New `deploy-landing.sh` (S3/CloudFront/ACM/Route 53) and `bump-version.sh` (version bump across all files in one pass).
- **Quality prompts** - "Reporting-only" mode replaces strict read-only language, allowing gitignored validation artifacts while forbidding tracked-file writes. Walkthrough comment prompt added. Execution-loop and footgun evidence corrected.
- **Skill contracts** - goat-critique: explicit invocation binding (no triviality bypass), tighter retrieval/rubric handling, context-leak scanning, per-agent tool budgets. goat-qa: Phase 2 is now a blocking gate awaiting human decision before producing the test plan.
- **Active plan semantics** - `.goat-flow/tasks/.active` treated as an advisory local pointer, not a setup invariant. Missing/stale markers fall back to listing task dirs and asking. ADR-017, glossary, code-map, and quality prompt aligned.
- **Shared-reference docs** - Explicit `skill-quality-testing` split-file references replace brace shorthand. goat-security project-policy template documented across all agent skill copies.
- **Preflight coverage** - ESLint widened to `src/dashboard` in preflight and CI. Dashboard lint config and cleanup so the wider gate passes.
- **Cross-doc cleanup** - Router tables, code-map script listings, and instruction-file references synced to match current filesystem state.

## v1.2.2 - 2026-04-21

Dashboard browser-code split, release metadata bump, and CLI documentation corrections.

- **Dashboard app split** - `src/dashboard/app.ts` is now the Alpine state/composition layer, with readers, projects, prompts, setup/quality, and terminal flows moved into focused classic browser scripts loaded before `app.js`.
- **Asset coverage** - Dashboard integration tests now assert the split script tags and asset endpoints. Knip ignores cover the classic script entry points so unused-export checks do not treat script-tag globals as dead code.
- **Docs + release metadata** - README and public docs now consistently show `npx goat-flow` for package usage. Package, manifest, config, instruction headers, skill frontmatter, and current test stubs are bumped to v1.2.2.
- **Cleanup** - Removed dead type imports exposed by full typecheck and formatted the prompts view so preflight remains clean after the split.

## v1.2.1 - 2026-04-20

Dashboard project rename, `gh`-powered PR/issue intake for `goat-review` and `goat-qa`, install anchors for `decisions/` and `logs/sessions/`, and follow-up doc/footgun/lesson fixes.

- **Dashboard project rename** - Inline header rename (double-click name or ✎ button) with user-supplied titles persisted alongside paths/favorites in `.goat-flow/dashboard-state.json`. New `decodeProjectTitles` server-boundary decoder (120-char cap, whitespace-only drops the override so clearing round-trips to the path-derived fallback). `displayNameFor(path)` replaces path-basename derivation across sorting, projects page, and sessions rail. Project accent color is now hashed from path (not display name) so renames don't shift the color.
- **External context sources (shared preamble)** - New section in `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md` making `gh` (when installed and authenticated) the preferred channel for issues, PRs, Dependabot alerts, and CI runs. Fetched content is treated as citable evidence; when `gh` is missing the user is asked to paste rather than have the skill fabricate.
- **goat-review PR intake** - "PR mode" now asks for a PR URL or number first (`gh pr view --json` + `gh pr diff`) instead of the base-branch prompt - one input collapses base, head, description, and linked issues. Base-branch-vs-fetch flow retained as fallback when no PR link is supplied or `gh` is unavailable. Updated across `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.github/`, and `workflow/` skill copies.
- **goat-qa PR / issue intake** - Step 0 Intake now asks for the linked PR or issue (`gh pr view` / `gh issue view`) so gap analysis maps against stated acceptance criteria rather than code shape alone. New `no-intent-spec` degradation flag in Verification Integrity when the spec is unavailable. Updated across all four skill copies.
- **Install + manifest anchors** - New `touch_anchor` helper in `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh` seeds `.goat-flow/decisions/.gitkeep` and `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/.gitkeep` on install so the learning-loop + continuity-note directories exist in fresh projects. `workflow/manifest.json` adds both anchors to required paths.
- **Preset prompts** - "Testing Gap Analysis" renamed to "Testing Gap & Overlap Analysis" with a new PR-scoped prompt body: overlap audit that excludes work already covered by PHPStan / Doctrine / CI access-control scanner / PHPUnit / Cypress / dev notes / Copilot review comments, then four grounding questions (A. entry points, B. production data shape, C. access control, D. prior incidents) with VERIFIED/INFERRED labels, then a time-budgeted residual test plan ranked by signal-per-minute, a sufficiency verdict, and one "action required on PR" item when testing can't compensate for a code-level issue. Description updated to match.
- **Docs + footguns** - `README.md` switches from `npx goat-flow` to `goat-flow` in usage examples (expects a global install). `docs/audit-and-quality.md` satellite-agents example corrected (`.gemini/skills/` → `.github/skills/`). New footgun in `.goat-flow/footguns/docs-and-crossrefs.md`: **Prose examples for agent-specific paths drift from the manifest** - name-based inference (`gemini` → `.gemini/skills/`) is wrong by default because codex and gemini both share `.agents/skills/`, and `doc-paths-resolve` only checks existence, so a plausible-but-wrong path that happens to exist passes the audit silently. Prevention: grep `workflow/manifest.json` before hand-writing agent-specific paths. `goat-plan` Excuse/Reality table drops the "team is experienced, spike is overkill" row.
- **Lesson + auditor footgun** (`1899366`) - Preflight's sanitization pipeline (`| grep -oE '^[0-9]+$' | tail -1`) could turn non-empty node output into empty output for the first time; `setup_count` was only assigned inside the `[[ -n "$build_count" ]]` branch but referenced unconditionally later, crashing under `set -u` with `unbound variable`. New lesson in `.goat-flow/lessons/agent-behavior.md` on tracing downstream references when adding output filters, and a matching auditor footgun update.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-04-20

Skill renames, Copilot CLI support, audit subsystem expansion (drift/content/manifest), proof-gate verification, structured learning loop, and an M17 quality-report follow-up wave that closed a CRITICAL Bash secret-read gap. 324 files changed, 86 commits.

- **Renames** - `goat-sbao`→`goat-critique`, `goat-test`→`goat-qa`, CLI `critique`→`quality`. Old names recorded in `workflow/manifest.json:stale_names`. Dashboard view, `/api/critique`→`/api/quality`, `critique.html`→`quality.html`, `docs/audit-and-critique.md`→`docs/audit-and-quality.md`.
- **Copilot CLI** - 4th agent (ADR-020). `.github/skills/`, `.github/hooks/`, `.copilotignore`, standalone `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. `deny-dangerous.sh` emits `permissionDecision` JSON for all four agents.
- **Audit + manifest** - New `audit --check-drift` (installed vs template skills), `audit --check-content` (cold-path linter for docs/footguns/lessons), `goat-flow manifest` (validate/list/show). Factual + snapshot claim checks against `workflow/manifest.json`. Dead-CLI-command scanning in fenced code blocks. `getProjectStructure()` removed; callers use `loadManifest()`.
- **Harness typing** - 16 checks split into `integrity`/`advisory`/`metric`. Score reflects integrity + unacknowledged advisory only. `harness.acknowledge: [check-id]` opts out deliberate skips. `Notification`/`compact` hook removed (never a real Claude Code event).
- **Hallucination red-flags** - 5 rules added to CLAUDE.md VERIFY: tests-pass needs terminal output, completion needs files-list, fix needs reproduction steps, no hedged claims, check-passed needs verbatim output.
- **Proof-gate + skill hardening** - Shared evidence gate (file:line, exit codes, transcripts) across `goat-debug`/`goat-qa`/`goat-review`/`goat-security`. goat-review: two-pass reading, severity (BLOCK/WARN/NOTE) + action (FIX/INVESTIGATE/ACCEPT) tags, spec-drift lane, Review Integrity self-check. goat-qa audit mode: A1 scope→A2 inventory→A3 coverage→A4 gap report. goat-critique locked to delegated-only mode (ADR-021).
- **goat-security** - 7 per-topic reference packs: auth-authz, cicd-and-agent-surfaces, common-threats, dependency-and-supply-chain, file-upload-and-paths, project-policy-template, secrets-and-data-exposure (ADR-023).
- **Learning loop** - `last_reviewed` frontmatter on footguns/lessons/decisions. New `goat-flow stats --check` with per-bucket freshness bands + search-anchor resolution. Active-plan marker `.goat-flow/tasks/.active` disambiguates live vs archived plans. 6 glossary terms added.
- **Quality reports** - Agents write JSON directly to `.goat-flow/logs/quality/` (HHMM+rand5 filename); `quality capture` removed. Schema v2 adds per-finding `evidence_method` + optional `scope`/`rubric_version`. New `goat-flow quality validate` and dashboard quality-history view.
- **Dashboard** - Dedicated Prompts page with category filters, Sessions rail (cap=10), quality-history view. Server split into `dashboard.ts` + `dashboard-routes.ts` + `dashboard-terminal.ts` + `setup-detect.ts` + `dashboard-assets.ts`. Presets moved to `src/dashboard/preset-prompts.json`, stack tables to `workflow/project-stack-data.json`. State persistence in `.goat-flow/dashboard-state.json` (was port-scoped localStorage).
- **goat-critique overhaul** - Conversational Phase 4 gate (question-first format with defaults), top-of-output Verdict block, SKEPTIC/ANALYST/STRATEGIST as explicit per-finding sub-fields, rubric coverage gates, Phase 3 budget cap (max 3 cross-exam agents) + early-exit on consensus, Agent C isolation hardening, Phase 3 persistence to `.goat-flow/logs/critiques/`, sharpened Agent B (ranked alternatives + must-surface-one).
- **follow-ups** - CRITICAL: `deny-dangerous.sh` now blocks Bash reads of `.env*`/`.ssh/`/`.aws/`/credentials/`*.pem`/`*.key` across all 4 hook dirs (settings.json Read() deny doesn't bind Bash). Server-boundary runtime decoders (`src/cli/server/decoders.ts`) for every HTTP/WS ingress. `loadConfig` fail-closed on validation error. Agent-id canonical source: `AgentId` union + `KNOWN_AGENT_IDS` tuple (ADR-022). Dashboard under TS bar. CLI ESLint 20→0 warnings. `npm test`: 307/307.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-04-17

Scanner/rubric system removed. Replaced by deterministic audit with 16 build checks (12 project setup + 4 per-agent) and 16 advisory harness checks across 5 concerns. Deterministic install script. Dashboard overhaul with dynamic recommended actions. 528 files changed.
- 
- **Critique Fixes** - Dual-critique synthesis resolved 10 findings. Fixed architecture.md build check count (17→16). Removed stop-lint.sh from core (project-specific concern, will revisit in a later version). Resolved 3 stale footgun entries (advisory hooks, swallows failures, dispatcher verb gap). Removed dead goat-review "code-review instruction file" reference. Reworded goat-test "multi-model" to actionable "cross-agent verification". Added analyse/evaluate/critique verbs to dispatcher disambiguation table. Improved critique prompt with 7 refinements: no-mutation warning, audit PASS caveat, severity definitions, scoped tool guidance, footgun currency checks, numeric claim verification, skill testing clarification.
- **Audit System** - Replaced scanner/rubric engine (79 checks + 12 anti-patterns, point-based scoring) with audit system. 12 project-wide setup checks (config, directories, required files) are agent-agnostic. 4 per-agent checks (instruction file, skills, settings, deny-dangerous hook) run independently per agent. Advisory harness scoring (`--harness`) grades 5 concerns with 16 checks total: context, constraints, verification, recovery, feedback loop. Audit became the sole evaluation engine.
- **Install Script** - `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh` handles all mechanical file copying: 7 skill templates, hooks, settings, templates, reference files, config scaffold. Deterministic, agent-aware (`--agent claude|codex|gemini`), idempotent. A separate migration script existed during v1.1.0 and was later removed as unused.
- **Setup Prompts** - Stripped stack/toolchain info, signal-driven tasks, stale artifact cleanup, multi-agent consistency directives. Setup prompt now: run install script → follow numbered setup steps → verify with audit. Upgrade prompt (v0.9/v1.0) structured as numbered steps with scripts first.
- **Dashboard** - Dynamic recommended actions panel: setup failing → fix wizard + fix agent buttons; harness checks failing → fix harness buttons; quality < 100% → fix harness buttons with per-concern recommendations; healthy → review/test/security presets. Per-agent harness score cards with grade, concern bars, and expandable recommendations. Projects page sorts alphabetically, clicks navigate to home view.
- **Config Agent Filtering** - Auditor respects `config.yaml` agents list. Project setup checks are agent-agnostic. Per-agent checks only run for agents with instruction files present. Config always lists all three agents (claude, codex, gemini) - setup is per-agent, not project-locked.
- **CLI Renames** - `--quality` → `--harness`. `quality-checks.ts` → `harness-checks.ts`. `build-checks.ts` → `agent-setup-checks.ts`. Dashboard label "AI Harness Checks" → "Agent Setup Checks".
- **Critique** - `goat-flow critique . --agent claude` generates agent-driven review prompts from audit data. Separate from audit (subjective vs deterministic).
- **Security** - `execSync` → `execFileSync` in hook syntax validator (shell injection fix). Host header validation on all dashboard API routes.
- **Skills** - 7 canonical skills (goat, goat-debug, goat-plan, goat-review, goat-sbao, goat-security, goat-test). Quick/full depth modes. Conversational structure with Step 0 adaptive gate. Skills installed verbatim from templates - project-specific context comes from instruction file and `.goat-flow/` docs.
- **Setup Flow** - 6 numbered steps (system overview → instruction file → install skills → architecture/code-map → customise → verification). Agent-specific configs in `workflow/setup/agents/`. Upgrade paths for v0.9 and v1.0 projects.
- **Hooks** - `deny-dangerous.sh` supports stdin and argv input, `--self-test` flag, blocks `rm -rf`, force push, `--no-verify`, `chmod 777`, pipe-to-interpreter patterns. Post-turn lint hook removed from core - project-specific concern (see `workflow/hooks/README.md`).
- **Templates** - 5 project templates (feature-brief, mob-elaboration, compliance-checklist, flow-diagram-guide, requirements-template) remain in `workflow/templates/` as reference material. Removed from core install (no longer copied to `.goat-flow/templates/`).
