## v1.1.0 - 2026-04-06 (in progress)

Setup overhaul driven by 10 real-project reviews. Setup agents now understand design intent, not just the checklist.

**M01 — Foundation**
- `workflow/setup/shared/system-overview.md` — 58-line orientation doc read by setup agents first
- ADR-028 (extract skill conventions), ADR-029 (instruction budget constraint), ADR-030 (skill consolidation 9→5+dispatcher)
- ADR-031 (setup file ownership — never delete user code, single-agent scoping)
- compose-setup.ts: removed wrong scaling table, fixed enforcement→advisory language, added anti-duplication examples

**M02 — Skills & Scanner**
- Extracted 152-line shared conventions from 5 skills to `.goat-flow/skill-conventions.md` with 7-line inline fallback (ADR-028 supersedes ADR-023)
- Killed flush protocol, todo.md, handoff.md — milestone file checkboxes replace all three
- Scanner: removed handoff checks (3.3.1, 3.3.1a, 2.4.7), AP11 no longer penalises empty learning loop, added skill-conventions.md check, removed guidelines-ownership-split checks
- goat-plan: 10-bullet TL;DR summary confirmation step before milestone approval
- goat-test: DDT (Development Driven Testing) guidance in Step 0
- goat-review/goat-security: boundary notes clarifying ownership split

**M03a — Setup Restructure**
- Merged 7 shared setup files → 3 (phase-1.md, execution-loop.md + system-overview.md + coding-standards.md); phase-0.md was later removed
- Created `workflow/hooks/` with copyable scripts + per-agent config templates (claude.json, codex.toml, gemini.json)
- Rewrote 4 agent setup files: Claude 108→62, Codex 138→80, Gemini 98→46, Copilot 93→51 lines
- All agents now have human checklists, reference system-overview.md, use workflow/hooks/

**M03b — Doc Cleanup**
- Deleted ~3,000 lines: system-spec.md, design-rationale.md, five-layers.md, rubrics.md, getting-started.md, cross-agent-comparison.md, using-skills.md, docs/examples/, workflow/runtime/, workflow/templates/
- Updated 100+ cross-references across .goat-flow/, test fixtures, scanner code, instruction files
- All workflow/** files updated with v1.1.0 references

**M08 — Post-Critique Fixes** (driven by Codex implementing + critiquing v1.1.0 across 11 projects)
- Setup guard: state gate in all 4 agent setup files + system-overview + phase-1 prevents rogue rewrites on current projects
- compose-setup.ts: v0.9/v1.0 blocks return early — no more fall-through to fresh-install path that caused parallel surfaces on 5 projects
- Split `upgrade.md` into `upgrade-0.9.x.md` and `upgrade-1.0.0.md` with destructive migration instructions
- Created `workflow/setup/project-structure.json` — single source of truth for expected file layout
- Scanner: removed CI Validation checks 3.2.1–3.2.5 (6pts, not AI workflow), fixed grep -P false positive (9/11 projects), fixed 2.6.1a pointer-file exemption (8/11 projects)
- Removed format-file.sh and guard-write-size.sh from goat-flow system — only deny-dangerous.sh and stop-lint.sh ship
- Skills: purged all stale v1.0 refs (todo.md, handoff.md, TODO_*_prime, flush), SBAO opt-in, compliance mode opt-in, fixed skill-conventions.md contradiction
- Reduced default .goat-flow/ scaffold (no domain-reference.md, always glossary.md)
- Dashboard: added /api/rubrics endpoint, light mode fix for setup page

## v1.0.0 - 2026-04-05

Version bump from v0.10.0 for semver compatibility (`^0.9.x` won't resolve to `0.10.0`).

**CLI** - Removed `--no-open` flag and auto-open browser logic from dashboard. Removed `spawn` import. Dashboard always prints URL, user opens manually.
**Dependencies** - `ws` moved from optionalDependencies to dependencies (required for dashboard WebSocket). `node-pty` stays optional.
**Keywords** - Added `ai-agent`, `claude-code`, `copilot`, `dashboard`, `llm`, `scanner` to package.json for npm discoverability.

---

## v0.10.0 - 2026-04-05

SBAO Phase 3, dashboard redesign, rubric priority grading, security hardening, copilot support, 48-file CLI refactor. 115 checks + 20 anti-patterns. 1,166 tests.

**Dashboard Redesign** - Neutral zinc palette (#1a1a1e/#111114/#27272a), CSS extracted to `styles.css`, JS extracted to `app.js` (index.html 89 lines). Dark/light themes with `gf-*` design token classes. Live reload dev mode (`npm run dev`).
**Home Page** - Action-driven: dynamic "What to do next" cards (issues → fix/details/workspace, passing → code review/test/security with play icons). Scanner-style 4-column agent cards with color-coded tier bars (green >80%, orange 50-80%, red <50%). Agents table with per-agent terminal launch. Welcome state for unconfigured projects.
**Scanner** - Single-page with inline detail expansion (no separate detail page). Hover states via CSS classes. Severity badges themed for light mode.
**Workspace** - Prompt preview on sidebar click (right panel shows prompt text + Launch button). Run state tracking (amber running, green pass). Category-colored filter pills. Round outline play/send buttons.
**Setup** - Left column card (title + agents + detected config), right prompt card with dark code background. "Formatter" label. Page heading.
**Config** - Two-row layout (path picker + role selector). userRole toggle (click to select, click again to deselect). Local-only (not in committed config). "Open Setup Wizard" button when config.yaml missing.
**Header** - Centered nav, goat emoji, green project name. "Terminal:" agent selector with disabled state during session. Green dot on Workspace nav when terminal running.
**Copilot** - Agent detection, terminal sessions, Runner type, RUNNER_BINARIES. Dashboard shows dimmed card when not scanned. ADR-025.
**Security** - Host header validation on all API routes (DNS rebinding). Write/Edit deny for 12 sensitive file patterns. Terminal resize validation (`clampDim`). Session map cleanup on kill.
**persona→userRole** - Renamed across config reader, types, facts, rubric, prompts, tests, fixtures. Added `tester` to schema.
**SBAO** - goat-plan Phase 3 rewritten as multi-agent critique: 2 core trio + 1 fresh-context (never split perspectives). Bold reminder in skill file. SBAO routing in dispatcher.
**Presets** - all 19 rewritten to `/goat [plain language]`. Guided forms removed.
**Rubric** - priority field (required/recommended/optional) on all checks. Grade: A=all req+rec, B=all req+80% rec, C=all req. Full tier bonus-only. 24 checks hidden. `telemetry` in KNOWN_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS.
**Scanner** - hook honesty, router validation, severity-grouped output. GOAT_FLOW_INLINE_SETUP dead code removed.
**CLI** - 48 files refactored, 45→0 complexity violations. `setup/`→`workflow/setup/`, `ai/`→`.goat-flow/`. Server logging (errors, host blocks, dev request log).
**Learning Loop** - category bucket files (ADR-021). Alpine.js `:style` footgun documented. SBAO agent structure lesson (3 recurrences). Checkbox discipline lesson (3 recurrences).
**Tests** - 275→1,166. Terminal idle timeout updated for session deletion. Tautological/dead assertions fixed. deny-dangerous.sh hardened (long-form flags, pipe-to-interpreter).
**Structure** - `docs/skills/` with Mermaid diagrams, `.goat-flow/glossary.md`, preflight with decimal timing. Footer: "Built by BlunderGOAT · v0.10.0".
