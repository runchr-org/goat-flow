# Changelog

## v1.2.0 - 2026-04-20

Skill-compliance trio (drift detection, content linting, manifest), skill renames, audit subsystem expansion, goat-review hardening, shared proof-gate, and a broad quality-report follow-up wave (M17). 130+ files changed (plus M17's ~40 files touched), 9+ new test files, 5 new decision records (including ADR-022 agent-authority canonical source), and a renamed critique-core record. Milestones M01-M07 and M17 shipped from the 1.2.0 plan; M08-M16 remain in progress (M13, M16 partially shipped).

- **Skill Renames** - `goat-sbao` → `goat-critique` and `goat-test` → `goat-qa`. Mechanical rename only — behaviour, step structure, routing semantics, and the critique-as-core-feature stance were preserved. Old names recorded in `workflow/manifest.json:stale_names` for orphan detection.
- **CLI: critique → quality** - `goat-flow critique` → `goat-flow quality`. Dashboard view, `/api/critique` → `/api/quality`, prompt title, `compose-critique.ts` → `compose-quality.ts`, `critique.html` → `quality.html`, `docs/audit-and-critique.md` → `docs/audit-and-quality.md`, `harness-critique-quality.md` → `harness-quality.md`. Pairs cleanly with `audit`: audit answers "is it installed?", quality answers "is it any good?".
- **Harness Check Type Tagging** - 16 harness checks split into `integrity`/`advisory`/`metric` types. Score reflects integrity + unacknowledged advisory only; maturity surfaced as counts, not failures. New `harness.acknowledge: [check-id]` config opts out deliberate skips. Resolves halaxy-cypress field report where stale architecture.md path (drift) and missing compaction hook (best practice) were framed identically as "failing concerns".
- **Hallucination Red-Flags** - Five red-flag rules added to CLAUDE.md VERIFY phase: tests-pass evidence requirement, completion claim files-list requirement, fix verification reproduction steps, no-hedged-claims rule, check-passed verbatim-output requirement. Counter-rationalization patterns inline.
- **Active-Plan Marker** - `.goat-flow/tasks/.active` marker file tells `/goat` and `/goat-plan` which `tasks/<version>/` directory is live, so agents stop starting work in `_archived/` clutter (~400 files). Skill files (`goat`, `goat-plan`) updated to consult the marker.
- **Skill Drift Detection** - New `goat-flow audit --check-drift` compares installed `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `.gemini/skills/` against `workflow/skills/` templates. Reports diverged, missing, and orphan skills. Backs M07 rename rollout and gates M08 propagation.
- **Cold-Path Content Linting** - New `goat-flow audit --check-content` lints `docs/`, `.goat-flow/`, ADRs, footgun and lesson entries for vague instructions, missing provenance frontmatter, and factual drift. Owns the provenance schema (`src/cli/audit/provenance-types.ts`) that M11 will back-fill onto existing audit checks.
- **Single Source of Truth Manifest** - New `goat-flow manifest` command (validate, list, show) plus `src/cli/manifest/{manifest.ts,types.ts,consumers.md}`. Extends `workflow/manifest.json` to host duplicated facts (skill list, audit check counts, version pins) consumed by setup prompts, audit, dashboard, and docs. Snapshot at `workflow/manifest-snapshots/v1.1.0.json` for diff-based drift detection.
- **Snapshot + Factual Claim Checks** - New `check-snapshot-claims.ts` and `check-factual-claims.ts` validate doc claims (skill counts, version strings, audit check counts) against the manifest. Integrated into `audit --check-content` output.
- **goat-review Hardening** - Two-pass reading protocol (skim then deep-dive). Severity (BLOCK/WARN/NOTE) and action (FIX/INVESTIGATE/ACCEPT) tags on every finding. Spec-drift detection lane. New "Review Integrity" self-check section. Edge-case scanning categories expanded. Skill description rewritten.
- **Proof-Gate** - Shared verification gate consumed by `goat-debug`, `goat-qa`, `goat-review`, `goat-security`. Forces named evidence (file:line, exit codes, output transcripts) before declaring work done. Skill patches applied across all four.
- **Audit Counts Sync** - Hot-path docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`) aligned to 13 setup checks + 4 per-agent checks = 17. Preflight B.8a3 added as downstream drift guard. `goat-plan` SKILL.md re-synced. AGENTS.md DoD and hook paths re-aligned.
- **Dashboard Home Cards** - Home view rewritten (`src/dashboard/views/home.html`, ~286 lines) for human-friendly AI harness presentation. Preset prompts and dashboard `globals.d.ts` updated.
- **Documentation** - `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` switched to `npx goat-flow` invocations and added type-checking step. New `.goat-flow/tasks/README.md` and `.goat-flow/scratchpad/README.md` clarify the local-only WIP convention. Per-directory `.gitignore` files updated.
- **Decision Records** - Added records for the active-plan marker, human-friendly AI harness home cards, no standalone `goat-verify`, and the skill rename cleanup. The critique-core record was renamed from `sbao-mob-core-features` to `critique-mob-core-features` and updated to match the M07 rename. Existing skill-doctrine records were touched up for terminology consistency.
- **Skill Files** - 7 canonical skills synced across `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `workflow/skills/`: `goat`, `goat-critique` (was goat-sbao), `goat-debug`, `goat-plan`, `goat-qa` (was goat-test), `goat-review`, `goat-security`. `skill-preamble.md` updated.
- **Tests** - 8 new test files: `audit-drift.test.ts`, `verification-boundaries.test.ts`, `check-content-quality.test.ts`, `check-drift.test.ts`, `check-factual-claims.test.ts`, `check-snapshot-claims.test.ts`, `manifest.test.ts`, `provenance-types.test.ts`. `critique-command.test.ts` renamed to `quality-command.test.ts`. `preamble-sync.test.ts`, `audit-command.test.ts`, `provenance-types.test.ts` expanded. ~1,900 net test lines added.
- **Lessons + Footguns** - Updates to `.goat-flow/lessons/{verification,agent-behavior,design-decisions}.md`, `.goat-flow/footguns/skills.md`, and `.goat-flow/glossary.md` (6 previously-undefined terms added: CSO, rationalization table, harness, concern, integrity/advisory/metric, rubber-stamp).
- **Quality-Report Follow-Ups (slot reused 2026-04-19)** - Four 2026-04-19 agent-generated quality reports surfaced real defects the audit was passing: a CRITICAL Bash secret-read gap (runtime-probe caught it; three static-only reports missed it), a dead `Notification`/`compact` hook the harness reported as installed, 17-vs-16 harness-check doc drift, and a `goat-qa` audit-mode output-contract mismatch. M17 closes them in 14 slices, expanded mid-flight to absorb a TypeScript-safety critique (T1-T7). Core fixes:
  - **Bash secret-read deny + harness false-pass** - `deny-dangerous.sh` now blocks shell reads of `.env*`, `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.gnupg/`, `.docker/config.json`, `.kube/config`, credentials, `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.pfx`, `.npmrc`/`.pypirc` across `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/` (4 hook dirs) and the `workflow/hooks/` template. New `bashDenyCoversSecrets` fact in `src/cli/facts/agent/hooks.ts`; `harness/check-constraints.ts` now requires BOTH `readDenyCoversSecrets` AND `bashDenyCoversSecrets` to pass `deny-covers-secrets`. New footgun in `auditor.md` documenting that `settings.json` Read() deny does NOT bind Bash shell reads.
  - **Removed Notification/compact machinery** - 14-file deletion across settings files, scanner (`detectCompactionHookExists`, `compactionHookExists` fact, `compaction_support` capability), harness check (`check-recovery.ts` `compactionHook`), tests, docs, and the `.goat-flow/footguns/hooks.md` entry about Codex lacking the hook. Recovery concern now has 2 integrity checks (milestone-tracking, session-logs). Claude Code's compaction actually fires `PreCompact`/`PostCompact`; `Notification`+matcher `"compact"` was never a real event.
  - **Doc + code-map drift** - Reconciled 17→16 harness-check counts across `docs/audit-and-quality.md`, `docs/cli.md`, `docs/harness-audit.md`, `docs/harness-quality.md`, `.goat-flow/architecture.md`. Added `copilot.md` + `skill-quality-testing.md` to `.goat-flow/code-map.md` inventories. Extended `check-factual-claims.ts` with 5 new regex patterns (`ai-harness-count-drift`, `harness-structural-count-drift`, `harness-scope-flag-count-drift`, `harness-checks-by-type-drift`, plus the existing `harness-check-count-drift`). `README.md:13` rewritten to match ADR-014 (no more `toolchain`/`ask_first` references).
  - **goat-qa audit-mode output contract** - `Output Format` now has `### Standard mode` (diff-driven, existing `Change Risk Map`) and `### Audit mode` (no-diff, `Gap Report` with blocking-gap/high-value/defer tiers + role-classification table). Propagated to all four installed copies (.claude/, .agents/, .github/ + workflow template).
  - **Quality schema v2** - New per-finding `evidence_method: "runtime-probe" | "static-analysis" | "mixed"` (required on emission, tolerantly defaulted to `"static-analysis"` on load for v1 reports); optional top-level `scope: "framework-self" | "consumer"` and `rubric_version: string`. 4 new schema tests. Backward-compat: all 30+ existing reports under `.goat-flow/logs/quality/` continue to load.
  - **Config fail-closed (critique T1)** - `src/cli/config/reader.ts` no longer forwards a partial merge when validation fails; `loadConfig` returns `cloneDefaults()` so downstream consumers (`facts/orchestrator.ts`, `agents/registry.ts`) never see malformed shapes. 2 new regression tests.
  - **Raw manifest access removed (critique T2)** - `getProjectStructure()` deleted from `src/cli/paths.ts`. Four callers (`paths.ts`, `audit.ts:328`, `check-drift.ts:128`, `facts/agent/skills.ts:73`) + 2 contract tests migrated to `loadManifest()`. `Manifest` type extended with `required_files` + `required_dirs` so the validated source carries everything audit needs.
  - **Server-boundary runtime decoders (critique T3)** - New `src/cli/server/decoders.ts` with pure-TS `decodeTerminalCreateBody`, `decodeProjectsListBody`, `decodeClientMessage`. Every ingress boundary (POST `/api/terminal/create`, POST `/api/projects/list`, WebSocket `ClientMessage`) returns typed `{ ok: false, error, path }` on malformed input instead of casting through. Zero runtime deps. 14 new decoder tests.
  - **Dashboard contract drift (critique T4)** - `src/dashboard/globals.d.ts:7` stops aliasing `RunnerId` to `string`; now `"claude" | "codex" | "gemini" | "copilot"` mirror union. `readRunnerId` validates against `KNOWN_RUNNER_IDS` and narrows unknown values to `null`. `SetupData.agents` widened to `Partial<Record<RunnerId, boolean>>` so dynamic-key construction stays valid.
  - **Dashboard under TS bar (critique T5)** - Removed `src/dashboard/**` from ESLint ignores. Swapped `projectService: true` for explicit `project: ["./tsconfig.json", "./tsconfig.dashboard.json"]` in `eslint.config.mjs` so typescript-eslint discovers dashboard files compiled under the separate tsconfig. Surfaced 60 errors in `src/dashboard/app.ts` (dynamic-delete, complexity, floating-promises, restrict-plus-operands) — deferred to a follow-up; preflight's ESLint stage still scopes to `src/cli/` so baseline stays green.
  - **Agent-authority cleanup (critique T6)** - `.goat-flow/decisions/ADR-022-agent-authority-canonical-source.md` records the hybrid choice: `AgentId` union in `src/cli/types.ts` + `KNOWN_AGENT_IDS` const tuple exported from `src/cli/agents/registry.ts`. Migrated hardcoded literals in `agents/registry.ts` (`isAgentId`), `quality/schema.ts:490` (`expectEnumValue`), and `quality/history.ts:17` (regex built from `KNOWN_AGENT_IDS.join("|")`).
  - **Regression + verification gates (critique T7)** - 5+5+2+14 = 26 new regression tests across M17-7..M17-10. Explicit checkpoint before the lint sweep.
  - **CLI ESLint sweep** - `npx eslint src/cli/` went from 20 warnings to 0. Non-null assertions replaced with narrow checks (regex destructuring with fallbacks, `flatMap` instead of `filter+!`, explicit `undefined` branches). Unnecessary conditionals removed.
  - **Collateral** - Fixed a bash arithmetic bug in `scripts/preflight-checks.sh:365-366` where `grep -c ... || echo "0"` produced `"0\n0"` when ESLint hit zero warnings (which it now does); the pre-existing `audit-drift round-trip fixture` test failure that had been blocking preflight since early in the session was resolved as a side-effect. Synced `workflow/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh` to the Copilot-aware variant (had been the Claude variant, which didn't emit `permissionDecision` JSON for Copilot payloads) so the installer deploys a hook that works for all four agents. Bumped `VERIFIED_ON` in `harness/check-constraints.ts` to 2026-04-19.
  - **Final gates** - `npm run typecheck`: clean. `npm test`: 307/307 pass. `npx eslint src/cli/`: 0 errors, 0 warnings. `bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh`: `PREFLIGHT PASSED — 45 checks, 0 warnings`. Full scope in `.goat-flow/tasks/1.2.0/M17-quality-report-followups.md`.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-04-17

Scanner/rubric system removed. Replaced by deterministic audit with 16 build checks (12 project setup + 4 per-agent) and 16 advisory harness checks across 5 concerns. Deterministic install script. Dashboard overhaul with dynamic recommended actions. 528 files changed.
- 
- **Critique Fixes** - Dual-critique synthesis resolved 10 findings. Fixed architecture.md build check count (17→16). Removed stop-lint.sh from core (project-specific concern, will revisit in a later version). Resolved 3 stale footgun entries (advisory hooks, swallows failures, dispatcher verb gap). Removed dead goat-review "code-review instruction file" reference. Reworded goat-test "multi-model" to actionable "cross-agent verification". Added analyse/evaluate/critique verbs to dispatcher disambiguation table. Improved critique prompt with 7 refinements: no-mutation warning, audit PASS caveat, severity definitions, scoped tool guidance, footgun currency checks, numeric claim verification, skill testing clarification.
- **Audit System** - Replaced scanner/rubric engine (79 checks + 12 anti-patterns, point-based scoring) with audit system. 12 project-wide setup checks (config, directories, required files) are agent-agnostic. 4 per-agent checks (instruction file, skills, settings, deny-dangerous hook) run independently per agent. Advisory harness scoring (`--harness`) grades 5 concerns with 16 checks total: context, constraints, verification, recovery, feedback loop. Audit became the sole evaluation engine.
- **Install Script** - `workflow/install-goat-flow.sh` handles all mechanical file copying: 7 skill templates, hooks, settings, templates, reference files, config scaffold. Deterministic, agent-aware (`--agent claude|codex|gemini`), idempotent. A separate migration script existed during v1.1.0 and was later removed as unused.
- **Setup Prompts** - Stripped stack/toolchain info, signal-driven tasks, stale artifact cleanup, multi-agent consistency directives. Setup prompt now: run install script → follow numbered setup steps → verify with audit. Upgrade prompt (v0.9/v1.0) structured as numbered steps with scripts first.
- **Dashboard** - Dynamic recommended actions panel: setup failing → fix wizard + fix agent buttons; harness checks failing → fix harness buttons; quality < 100% → fix harness buttons with per-concern recommendations; healthy → review/test/security presets. Per-agent harness score cards with grade, concern bars, and expandable recommendations. Projects page sorts alphabetically, clicks navigate to home view.
- **Config Agent Filtering** - Auditor respects `config.yaml` agents list. Project setup checks are agent-agnostic. Per-agent checks only run for agents with instruction files present. Config always lists all three agents (claude, codex, gemini) - setup is per-agent, not project-locked.
- **CLI Renames** - `--quality` → `--harness`. `quality-checks.ts` → `harness-checks.ts`. `build-checks.ts` → `agent-setup-checks.ts`. Dashboard label "AI Harness Checks" → "Agent Setup Checks".
- **Critique** - `goat-flow critique . --agent claude` generates agent-driven review prompts from audit data. Separate from audit (subjective vs deterministic).
- **Security** - `execSync` → `execFileSync` in hook syntax validator (shell injection fix). Host header validation on all dashboard API routes.
- **Skills** - 7 canonical skills (goat, goat-debug, goat-plan, goat-review, goat-sbao, goat-security, goat-test). Quick/full depth modes. Conversational structure with Step 0 adaptive gate. Skills installed verbatim from templates - project-specific context comes from instruction file and `.goat-flow/` docs.
- **Setup Flow** - 6 numbered steps (system overview → instruction file → install skills → architecture/code-map → customise → verification). Agent-specific configs in `workflow/setup/agents/`. Upgrade paths for v0.9 and v1.0 projects.
- **Hooks** - `deny-dangerous.sh` supports stdin and argv input, `--self-test` flag, blocks `rm -rf`, force push, `--no-verify`, `chmod 777`, pipe-to-interpreter patterns. Post-turn lint hook removed from core - project-specific concern (see `workflow/hooks/README.md`).
- **Templates** - 5 project templates (feature-brief, mob-elaboration, compliance-checklist, flow-diagram-guide, requirements-template) remain in `workflow/templates/` as reference material. Removed from core install (no longer copied to `.goat-flow/templates/`).
- **Tests** - 51 tests across unit, integration, and contract suites. Config filtering, scope coverage, quality concern coverage, cross-agent consistency.


## v1.0.0 - 2026-04-05

Version bump from v0.10.0 for semver compatibility (`^0.9.x` won't resolve to `0.10.0`).

- **CLI** - Removed `--no-open` flag and auto-open browser logic from dashboard. Removed `spawn` import. Dashboard always prints URL, user opens manually.
- **Dependencies** - `ws` moved from optionalDependencies to dependencies (required for dashboard WebSocket). `node-pty` stays optional.

- **Tests** - 275→1,166. Terminal idle timeout updated for session deletion. Tautological/dead assertions fixed. deny-dangerous.sh hardened (long-form flags, pipe-to-interpreter).
- **Structure** - `docs/skills/` with Mermaid diagrams, `.goat-flow/glossary.md`, preflight with decimal timing. Footer: "Built by BlunderGOAT · v0.10.0".
