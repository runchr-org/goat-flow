# CLAUDE.md - v1.0.0 (2026-04-05)
GOAT Flow test fixture.

## Essential Commands
```bash
npm test
bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh
bash scripts/context-validate.sh
```

## Execution Loop: READ -> CLASSIFY -> SCOPE -> ACT -> VERIFY -> LOG

**READ** - MUST read relevant files before changes. Never fabricate codebase facts.

**CLASSIFY** - Three signals before acting: intent, complexity tiers, mode. Re-classify when work exceeds 3x estimate.
- Hotfix
- Small Feature
- Standard
- System
- Infrastructure

**SCOPE** - MUST declare before acting: files allowed to change, non-goals, max blast radius.

**ACT** - MUST declare: `State: [MODE] | Goal: [one line] | Exit: [condition]`
- Plan
- Implement
- Debug
- Review

```
BAD: guessed the spec without reading .goat-flow/architecture.md:1
GOOD: read .goat-flow/architecture.md:1 before changing prompts
```

```
BAD: changed workflow/skills/goat-debug.md without updating router refs
GOOD: grep old paths after every rename
```

**VERIFY** - MUST run shellcheck on `.sh` changes. MUST check cross-references after renames. Two corrections on one approach = stop.

**LOG** - MUST update when tripped. Behavioural mistakes go in `.goat-flow/lessons/`. Architectural traps go in `.goat-flow/footguns/`. Session summaries go in `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/`.

## Autonomy Tiers

**Always:** Read files, run validation, edit within scope.

**Ask First**
1. Boundary touched: [name]
2. Related code read: [yes/no]
3. Footgun entry checked: [entry or none]
4. Local instruction checked: [`.goat-flow/architecture.md`, `workflow/skills/README.md`]
5. Rollback command: [exact command]

Boundaries:
- `.goat-flow/architecture.md`
- `.goat-flow/coding-standards/conventions.md`
- `src/`

**Never:** Delete docs without replacement, edit secrets, push to main, force push, overwrite files without checking.

## Definition of Done
1. bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh passes
2. bash scripts/context-validate.sh passes
3. No unapproved boundary changes
4. logs updated if tripped
5. milestone checkboxes current
6. rg old pattern after rename
