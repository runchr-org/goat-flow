/**
 * Regression tests for the consumer/packaged-install resilience pass.
 *
 * package.json `files` ships only `dist/` + `workflow/` + a few helpers.
 * Consumer installs therefore lack:
 *   - `src/` (used by manifest.ts to observe dashboard_views + presets_count)
 *   - `.goat-flow/*` and `docs/*` (used as evidence_paths on registered checks)
 *   - agent-scope dirs that the project doesn't install (single-agent setups)
 *
 * These tests simulate that environment via the `GOAT_FLOW_PACKAGED_MODE=1`
 * env var and assert the four code paths that previously crashed now succeed:
 *   1. `validateManifest` skips source-derived drift checks
 *   2. `validateProvenance` skips evidence_paths existence check (dev mode keeps it)
 *   3. `compareSkills` filters out absent agent roots
 *   4. `isPackagedInstall` is overridable for deterministic testing
 *
 * (The preflight shell-script skill-parity loop is covered by an assertion in
 * the preflight script itself - see `scripts/preflight-checks.sh` the
 * `[[ -d "$agent_dir" ]] || continue` guard before the installed-file check.)
