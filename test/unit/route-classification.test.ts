/**
 * Route classification consistency test.
 *
 * Every POST/DELETE entry in DASHBOARD_ROUTE_INVENTORY whose class is
 * "side-effectful" must also appear in SIDE_EFFECTFUL_EXACT_API_ROUTES. This
 * catches drift where a new mutating route is added to the inventory but the
 * Origin/CSRF check never fires because the exact-match set was not updated.
 *
 * Routes marked "privileged-websocket" or with parameter segments (`:id`) are
 * intentionally exempt - they have their own enforcement paths.
