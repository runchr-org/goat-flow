# Purpose:
#   Release goat-flow to npm with a preflight check and human confirmation.
#
# Usage:

#   2) runs build and tests
#   3) prints a dry-run publish summary
#   4) asks for manual confirmation before `npm publish`
#
# Exit:
#   0 if published or explicitly aborted, non-zero on failed build/test/publish.
#
# Requirements:
#   - node, npm
#   - package.json and build/test scripts configured for the project
