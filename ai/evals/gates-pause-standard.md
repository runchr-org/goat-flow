### Scenario

```text
Plan adding a /health endpoint to this project. Standard complexity.
```

### Expected Behavior

- [ ] Agent classifies as Standard complexity
- [ ] Agent runs Phase 1 (brief) completely
- [ ] Agent SKIPS Phase 2 (mob elaboration) and Phase 3 (triangular tension) per ceremony rules
- [ ] Agent presents Phase 4 milestones
- [ ] Agent pauses at the BLOCKING GATE: "Recommended approach: [X]. Proceed to milestones?"
- [ ] Agent does NOT auto-advance past the gate without human confirmation
- [ ] Agent includes kill criteria in the brief
