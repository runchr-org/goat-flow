# ADR-003: Remove confusion-log.md from the workflow

**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The GOAT Flow spec defined three learning loop files:
- `ai/lessons/` - agent behavioral mistakes
- `docs/footguns/` - architectural traps with file:line evidence
- `docs/confusion-log.md` - structural navigation confusion

The confusion log was designated create-on-first-use: it would materialise when an agent first experienced genuine structural confusion. After 7+ real implementations across apps, libraries, and script collections, the file was never created on any project. The "first use" never came.

The failure mode it was designed to catch (agent can't find where something lives) is already addressed by:
- The router table - maps every resource to its path
- `docs/architecture.md` - system orientation for agents

Meanwhile, the scanner penalized every project 1 point for the missing file (check 2.3.5) plus 2 points for the cascading router failure (check 2.4.2 - the router referenced confusion-log.md which didn't exist). That's 3 points lost on every scan for a feature that serves no purpose.

## Decision

Remove confusion-log.md from the workflow entirely:
- Remove rubric check 2.3.5
- Remove from all router tables (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md)
- Remove from spec docs, setup prompts, fragment registry, shared facts
- Remove `workflow/evaluation/confusion-log.md` template
- Remove from CI allowed-missing paths

Structural confusion is addressed by the router table and architecture.md.

## Consequences

- Every project gains ~3 points on self-scan (1 pt check + 2 pt router cascade)
- goat-flow repo went from B (87%) to A (92%) for Claude
- One fewer create-on-first-use artifact to explain to new users
- If structural confusion turns out to be a real problem in the future, lessons.md can capture it - no need for a separate file
- 47 references removed across 25 files
