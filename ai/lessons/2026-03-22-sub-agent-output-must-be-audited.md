**What happened:** Spawned 5 parallel agents to fix 5 projects. Agents created confusion-log.md (removed in ADR-003), left shape placeholders, introduced indentation errors, wrote hasRouter logic bug. None caught until external agents audited the output.
**Root cause:** "Tests pass" tunnel vision - treated green CI as proof of correctness. Sub-agent prompts didn't include ADR constraints. Never re-read the files agents wrote.
**Fix:** After spawning sub-agents, grep for removed patterns and read key output files. Include ADR constraints in every sub-agent prompt.
