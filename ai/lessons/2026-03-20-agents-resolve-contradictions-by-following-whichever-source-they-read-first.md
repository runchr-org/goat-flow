**What happened:** system-spec.md showed the old 5-step execution loop while execution-loop.md had the updated 6-step version with SCOPE. The setup prompt says "Read docs/system-spec.md" first. Both rampart and sus-form-detector agents absorbed the spec's loop and either didn't notice or couldn't override execution-loop.md. 7 of 8 gaps in sus-form-detector traced to this single contradiction.

**Prevention:** When updating any concept that appears in multiple files, update the file agents read FIRST (system-spec.md) before or at the same time as the authoritative source. Never assume agents will reconcile contradictions - they follow the first version they encounter.
