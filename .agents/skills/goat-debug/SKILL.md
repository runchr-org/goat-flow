## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md` for shared conventions.
On full-depth, also read `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-conventions.md`.

## When to Use

Use when diagnosing a bug or understanding unfamiliar code. For onboarding, use investigate mode.
- Bug/symptom --> **Diagnose mode**. Exploring, no bug --> **Investigate mode**.

**If you want to "just try something" before tracing the code path, STOP.** That is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The user already diagnosed it, hypotheses are ceremony" | A confidently stated cause is data, not diagnosis. Trace it or eliminate it before acting. |
| "Prod is on fire, D1 is a luxury" | Untraced fixes at 2am are how you get a 3-fix abort at 4am. D1 is the shortest path to a working fix. |
| "Type/config mismatch is a really clean story" | Clean stories that don't mechanically match the symptom (e.g. value-dependent failure from a value-blind cause) are wrong stories. |
| "The specific number in the bug report is probably just phrasing" | Treat every specific number, threshold, or boundary in a bug report as a clue, not rhetoric. |
| "Reading the footgun during an incident looks like second-guessing" | Reading the footgun IS doing your job. Not reading it is what looks bad at post-mortem. |
| "Adding the field is zero-risk — worst case we try the next thing" | This is how you enter the 3-fix abort loop. Hypothesis before code, always. |

**NOT this skill:** Reviewing → /goat-review. Test plans → /goat-qa. Planning milestones → /goat-plan. Feature briefs → dispatcher Planning Route.

## Step 0 - Choose Depth

If depth is pre-decided, proceed. Otherwise confirm quick vs full, or auto-detect from available input.
If vague, ask about: goal, symptom/error message, area involved.

**Quick path:** diagnose and report; **full path:** run D1–D4.
**Footgun check:** Read `.goat-flow/footguns/` and `.goat-flow/lessons/` for the target area. Surface matches.


## Diagnose Mode

### D1 - Investigate (no fixes)

After reading the primary file, write 2-3 hypotheses spanning at least 2 of: Data, Logic, Timing, Environment, Configuration. If the bug involves loops, indices, or pagination, include a boundary/counting hypothesis. After tracing, mark each: CONFIRMED / ELIMINATED / UNRESOLVED with `file:line` evidence.

**Multi-component failures** (CI → build → deploy, request → middleware → handler → DB, etc.): instrument each boundary before proposing any fix. For each component boundary, log what data enters and what exits, run once to gather evidence showing WHERE the chain breaks, THEN investigate the specific failing component. Do not guess the failing layer.

**Can't reproduce after 5 file reads?** Log what you checked, suggest logging additions, ask for more context.

### D2 - Diagnosis

Present: root cause + confidence (HIGH = reproduced, MEDIUM = traced, LOW = inferred) + hypothesis table + reproduction steps. **Confidence floor:** All LOW --> return to D1 or present partial findings.

**Root cause validation before claiming HIGH confidence.** For each candidate root cause, run a causation / necessity / sufficiency check:
- **Causation** — does the proposed cause mechanically produce the observed symptom? Trace the path with `file:line`.
- **Necessity** — without this cause, does the symptom still occur? If yes, the cause is insufficient or incomplete.
- **Sufficiency** — is this cause alone enough, or are there co-factors? Name them.

For high-stakes diagnoses, run a 5-Whys chain. Every "because" MUST cite `file:line` or a reproduction step, not just prose.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present diagnosis, then pause. Human decides: dig deeper, propose fix, or stop. If confidence is MEDIUM or LOW with multiple competing hypotheses, consider `/goat-critique` on the hypothesis set before choosing a fix direction.

### D3 - Fix Plan (only if human approved)

What changes (files + functions), blast radius, architecture check (`.goat-flow/architecture.md`), verification method. "Should I implement?" If yes --> implement, then D4.

### D4 - Post-Fix Verification
Rerun the **original reproduction** from D2 — a code change is not a fix until the symptom is gone. Then run D3 verification, check adjacent regressions, and grep for old patterns after renames.

**3-fix abort rule:** If three independent fixes have failed to resolve the symptom, STOP and reconsider whether the architecture or the root-cause hypothesis is wrong. Do not attempt a fourth patch without first re-entering D1 with a fresh hypothesis set.

**Proof Gate:** Apply the Proof Gate from `skill-preamble.md` to the "fixed" claim — rerun the original repro, cite the literal output, and downgrade to **UNVERIFIED** if the session cannot execute the proof.

## Investigate Mode

### I1 - Scope

Declare: **In scope** [files/dirs], **Out of scope** [what we skip], **Read estimate** [N files, pause at 3x].

**BLOCKING GATE:** "I'll investigate [scope] reading up to [N] files. Adjust?"

### I2 - Read (Progressive Depth)

Read in layers: (1) entry points, (2) critical path, (3) supporting files.
For each file log: role, connections, evidence tag (OBSERVED / INFERRED).

### I3 - Report

Required: **What I Didn't Read** (skipped files + reasons), **Current vs Expected State**, **Evidence tags** (OBSERVED/INFERRED).

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present report, pause. Human decides: go deeper, switch to diagnose, or close.

## Constraints

- MUST write hypotheses AFTER initial read of the primary file
- MUST include at least 2 hypothesis categories
- MUST NOT propose fixes until human reviews diagnosis (D2 to D3 gate)
- MUST declare scope before deep reading (investigate mode)
- MUST tag evidence as OBSERVED or INFERRED
- MUST include "What I Didn't Read" in every investigation report
- MUST check recurrence against footguns + lessons
- Universal constraints from skill-preamble.md apply.
- MUST verify fix doesn't violate architecture constraints

```markdown
## TL;DR       <!-- 1 sentence: root cause + confidence -->
## Hypotheses  <!-- table: #, Hypothesis, Category, Status, Evidence (file:line) -->
## Root Cause  <!-- Confidence + Location (file:line) + Description -->
## Reproduction Steps  <!-- numbered, with Expected vs Actual -->
## Fix Plan    <!-- only if human approved D3 -->
