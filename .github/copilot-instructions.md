# Copilot Instructions - GOAT Flow

Documentation framework for AI coding agent workflows. Markdown docs + TypeScript CLI scanner.

## Essential Commands

```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript
npm test               # Run all tests
npm run typecheck      # Type-check without emitting
shellcheck scripts/*.sh scripts/maintenance/*.sh
bash scripts/preflight-checks.sh
```

## Execution Loop: READ → CLASSIFY → SCOPE → ACT → VERIFY → LOG

**READ** - MUST read relevant files before changes. Never fabricate codebase facts.

**CLASSIFY** - Assess complexity: Hotfix (2 reads, 3 turns), Standard (4 reads, 10 turns), System (6 reads, 20 turns).

**SCOPE** - Declare files allowed to change, non-goals, max blast radius.

**ACT** - Declare mode (Plan/Implement/Debug) with goal and exit condition.

**VERIFY** - Run shellcheck on .sh changes. Check cross-references after renames. Two corrections on same approach = rewind.

**LOG** - Update ai/lessons/ (behavioral mistakes) or docs/footguns/ (architectural traps) when tripped.

## Autonomy Tiers

**Always:** Read any file, lint scripts, edit within assigned scope.

**Ask First:** Changes to docs/system-spec.md, setup/ prompts, workflow/skills/ templates, changes spanning 3+ files.

**Never:** Delete docs without replacement. Modify .env/secrets. Push to main. Force push.

## Definition of Done

MUST confirm ALL: (1) shellcheck passes (2) no broken cross-references (3) no unapproved boundary changes (4) logs updated if tripped (5) grep old pattern after renames.

## Working Memory

5+ turn tasks → .goat-flow/tasks/todo.md. Incomplete work → .goat-flow/tasks/handoff.md.

## Sub-Agent Objectives

ONE objective, structured return, 5-call budget.

## Communication When Blocked

One question with recommended default.
