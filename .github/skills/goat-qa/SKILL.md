## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md` before starting.
On full-depth, also read `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-conventions.md`.

## When to Use

goat-qa is a **testing gap analyser**: it maps changed code to testing coverage and prioritises what to test.

It does not write test code or run full test commands.

Output: prioritized "must test / safe to skip / should test" guidance.

**Invoke when:**
- Feature branch is ready for testing and you want to know what to focus on
- QA has a test plan and you want to verify it covers the actual code changes
- You're reviewing a PR and want to know what the tests miss
- You want to find manual testing gaps before a release
- You need a QA handoff artifact (flow diagram, risk matrix, manual test plan)

**NOT this skill:** Running tests, "test this", "test X" → just run them (action request, not gap analysis). Debugging test failures → /goat-debug. Code quality → /goat-review. Planning milestones → /goat-plan. Feature briefs → dispatcher Planning Route. Verifying a bug fix → /goat-debug. Verifying a diff/PR before merge → /goat-review. Certifying that work is complete → the Proof Gate in `skill-preamble.md`, applied by whoever makes the claim.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "CI is green so coverage is fine" | Scanner scored 100% while preflight failed with 8 errors. CI tests what was thought of; gap analysis looks for what wasn't. |
| "Unit tests cover it" | Structural tests that import and snapshot pass at high coverage but miss every behavioural edge. STRUCTURAL is not BEHAVIOURAL. |
| "Coverage report says 80%" | Coverage measures shape, not truth. 20+ content-accuracy failures survived a structural pass that reported high coverage. |
| "Doer ran the tests, so we're covered" | Doer-verifier is theater in single-agent context. The verifier must have a context boundary the doer did not cross. |

## Coverage Depth

Canonical vocabulary for classifying test coverage. Used by Standard mode (Phase 2), Audit mode (A3), and cross-skill references.

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| NONE | No matching test file or manual plan | New module with zero tests |
| STRUCTURAL | Tests exist but only import/construct/snapshot - no behaviour assertion | `expect(component).toBeDefined()` |
| PARTIAL-BEHAVIOURAL | Happy path or narrow behaviour only; error/edge paths untested | Login success tested, invalid-credentials path missing |
| BEHAVIOURAL | Meaningful output, side-effect, error-path, or invariant coverage | Asserts return value, DB side-effect, and thrown error |

## Step 0 - Intake

**Mode detection - confirm, don't silently decide:**

- Changed files + no specific ask → offer standard or audit
- "audit"/"coverage"/"gaps" → Audit mode (full depth)
- "verify coverage"/"what's risky"/"what should I test" or scoped files → Standard mode (quick depth)

**Depth mapping:** Standard mode = quick (analyse changed files). Audit mode = full (analyse a codebase area). If arriving from the dispatcher with depth pre-selected: quick → Standard, full → Audit.

Confirm: "Running [mode] on [scope]. Correct?"

**Gather:** changed scope, existing test plan (if any), audience. Check the instruction file's Essential Commands section or `package.json` scripts for test/lint commands.

**Footgun check:** Use the preamble's grep-first learning-loop retrieval on `.goat-flow/footguns/`, `.goat-flow/lessons/`, `.goat-flow/patterns/`, and `.goat-flow/decisions/` for the target area. Surface matches or an explicit retrieval miss; do not broad-load any bucket.

**PR / issue link (strongly encouraged):** ask for the PR URL or issue number before Phase 1 - stated acceptance criteria are the benchmark gap analysis maps against. If `gh` is available, resolve with `gh pr view` + `gh pr diff`. If unavailable or declined, note `no-intent-spec` in Verification Integrity; `safe to skip` confidence degrades when no intent spec exists.

If arriving from the dispatcher with context already gathered, confirm and proceed.

**No existing tests detected:** If the project has no test files, the risk analysis still applies. Flag coverage as "NONE" for all files. Note: "This project has no automated tests. All verification falls to human and AI reviewers."

**CHECKPOINT:** "Analysing [N] changed files against [existing test plan / no test plan]. Audience: [dev/tester/both]. Proceed?"

## Phase 1 - Change Risk Analysis

Read every changed file. For each, understand WHAT changed and WHY it's risky.

**Diff analysis - not just file names.** Read the actual diff, not just `--stat`. A one-line change to an auth check is CRITICAL. A 200-line change to a CSS file is LOW.

Classify each change:

| Risk | What it means | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| CRITICAL | If this breaks, users are directly affected or security is compromised | Auth logic, payment flow, data mutation, permission checks, API contracts |
| HIGH | Business logic or integration that affects correctness | Calculations, state transitions, cross-service calls, database queries |
| MEDIUM | Internal logic with limited blast radius | Utilities, validators, formatters, isolated components |
| LOW | Cosmetic, config, or changes with no behavioural impact | Styling, copy, constants, type-only changes |

**For each CRITICAL/HIGH change, trace the blast radius:**
- What depends on this code? (callers, consumers, downstream services)
- What user-visible flows pass through this code path?
- Has this area broken before? (check footguns/lessons)

**Output: Change Risk Map**

| File | Lines Changed | What Changed (plain English) | Risk | Blast Radius | User-Visible Impact |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|------|-------------|-------------------|

**CHECKPOINT:** "Risk map complete. [N] CRITICAL, [M] HIGH risk changes. Proceeding to gap analysis."

## Phase 2 - Gap Analysis

Compare risk vs coverage in both directions:
- If a test plan exists, map cases to CRITICAL/HIGH changes and check reverse coverage.
- If no plan exists, map changed files to automated tests and flag explicit behavior gaps.
- For each changed file, read the matched test file (if any) and classify using Coverage Depth. If tests are unavailable, record `tests not read` in Verification Integrity.
- Classify gaps as:
  - **Undertested risk**
  - **Misaligned effort**

For CRITICAL items with no coverage, annotate why: new path / missed coverage on existing path / hard-to-test.

**Intent vs Reality Diff (when intent spec exists):** If a PR, issue, test plan, or user-provided acceptance criteria is available, add:

| Expected Behaviour | Observed Code Behaviour | Gap | Risk |

Map each stated expectation to the code path that implements it. Gaps between intent and code are undertested-risk candidates.

**Cross-agent verification:** Suggest the user run verification with a different agent or model. Cross-agent verification catches blind spots that same-agent testing misses.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present the gap analysis plus Verification Integrity and stop for a human decision. "Here are the testing gaps. Continue to Phase 3 (targeted testing plan), or adjust the analysis first?" Reserve QA flow diagrams for the Phase 3 checkpoint. After the testing plan, suggest `/goat-plan` to add testing tasks to the current milestone.

## Phase 3 - Targeted Testing Plan

Based on the gaps, produce a focused plan and order by risk.

**Must test (CRITICAL gaps):** table with what breaks and grounded effort estimate; if effort is unknown, write `unknown - needs harness/project context`
**Should test if time allows (MEDIUM gaps):** same format, lower priority
**Safe to skip this round:** low-risk or adequately covered areas
**Misaligned effort:** deprioritise plan cases not mapped to current changes

**CHECKPOINT:** "Targeted testing plan ready. Want a flow diagram for any CRITICAL item?"

## Phase 4 - Flow Diagram

For flow diagrams, use Mermaid flowcharts with 8-15 nodes per diagram, happy path first, then branch points for error states and edge cases.

## Audit Mode

For a codebase area with no recent change. Audit mode analyses *what already exists* - which files carry load-bearing behaviour, which have test coverage, where that coverage is structural (import/construct only) versus behavioural (exercises real code paths). It does NOT read a diff; skip Phase 1 and its diff-specific constraints.

### A1 - Scope

Declare the audit boundary explicitly. Supported shapes:
- A directory (e.g. `src/cli/audit/`) - every source file inside.
- A module (e.g. `src/cli/quality/`) - the module's entry point and direct callees.
- A risk class (e.g. "everything touching auth tokens") - files you would need to read to verify the claim.

If unsure, ask the user before A1.5.

### A1.5 - Scope-Size Gate

Inventory the approximate file count in the declared boundary before deep analysis. If the area contains more files than can be read at full depth within budget, present a ranked slice prioritising load-bearing and interface-boundary files, and ask the user which slice to analyse. Proceed to A2 only after scope is confirmed manageable.

### A2 - Inventory and Risk Ranking

Without any diff, classify each in-scope file by its *role*, not its recency:

| Role | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Load-bearing | auth, payments, permission checks, data mutation, migration |
| Interface boundary | API routes, CLI commands, public exports |
| Integration glue | config loaders, filesystem bridges, external clients |
| UI / presentation | views, templates, styling |
| Support | types, constants, pure helpers |

Load-bearing + Interface files get CRITICAL or HIGH risk ratings by default.

### A3 - Coverage Analysis

For each in-scope file:
1. Does a test file exist? If not → coverage `NONE`.
2. If yes, read the test. Does it assert behaviour (outputs, side effects, error paths) or only construct the unit?
3. Flag mock-heavy tests (everything mocked = behaviour untested) and integration-only blind spots (suite skips when the external service is unavailable).

Record coverage using the Coverage Depth vocabulary above.

### A4 - Gap Report

Rank gaps by `Risk × (1 - CoverageLevel)` descending. Output:

- **Blocking gaps** - CRITICAL-risk file with NONE or STRUCTURAL coverage. One line per file: missing behaviour + the test the user should add.
- **High-value additions** - HIGH-risk file with PARTIAL coverage. Describe the untested path.
- **Defer** - LOW-risk or already well-covered files. Name them explicitly so the user sees what was considered and why.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present gap report; wait for human decision before generating plan files.

## Regression Guard Mode

Post-verification regression guard planning. Assumes the fix is already verified (by /goat-debug, human sign-off, or PR check). Cite the prior verification source. Define 1-2 invariants, assess coverage of each, then hand off recommended guard tests to the coding agent. This mode does NOT verify the fix itself - that is /goat-debug's domain.

## Constraints

- goat-qa is a testing GAP ANALYSER - it finds mismatches between code (changed or existing) and testing coverage
- MUST compare in-scope code against existing testing coverage (manual plan, automated tests, or neither)
- MUST find gaps in BOTH directions: undertested risks AND misaligned test effort
- MUST produce "must test / should test / safe to skip" tiers with rationale for skips
- MUST include Verification Integrity section
- MUST apply the Proof Gate from `skill-preamble.md` to every claim made in the gap analysis or testing plan
- MUST NOT generate test code - hand off to the coding agent
- Universal constraints from skill-preamble.md apply.
- Standard mode: MUST read the actual diff, not just file names - a one-line auth change outranks a 200-line CSS change
- Standard mode: MUST classify every change by risk level with plain-English description of what changed
- Standard mode: MUST trace blast radius for CRITICAL/HIGH changes
- Audit mode: MUST classify every in-scope file by role (load-bearing, interface, glue, UI, support), not by recency; MUST NOT read a diff or ask for one
- Audit mode: MUST include a risk-ranked gap report with blocking-gap / high-value-addition / defer tiers
- If flow diagrams are requested, use Mermaid flowcharts (8-15 nodes, happy path first, annotate gap status per node).
- Regression guard: MUST state invariants as human-readable sentences; MUST cite prior fix-verification source; MUST NOT verify the fix itself
- MUST defend zero-gap results explicitly: state what was checked and why no gaps surfaced. Zero gaps without justification is an error condition, not a clean bill.
