## Shared Conventions

Read `.goat-flow/skill-preamble.md` for shared conventions.
On full-depth, also read `.goat-flow/skill-conventions.md`.
If unavailable, use these essentials:
- Severity: SECURITY > CORRECTNESS > INTEGRATION > PERFORMANCE > STYLE
- Evidence: every finding MUST include file or file:line, tag OBSERVED vs INFERRED
- Learning loop: check .goat-flow/lessons/ and .goat-flow/footguns/ after completion
- Gates: BLOCKING GATE = stop and wait. CHECKPOINT = continue unless interrupted.

## When to Use

Use when a concrete artifact deserves multi-perspective critique before shipping. Takes ANY input artifact: a plan, security assessment, debug hypothesis set, review findings, test strategy, architecture proposal, or refactor approach.

**Use when:**
- The stakes justify spawning 3 sub-agents and 5 phases
- You have a concrete artifact to critique (not vague ideas)
- You want competing perspectives, not just validation
- Called by another goat-* skill or directly by the user

**NOT this skill:**
- No artifact exists yet → create one first (goat-review, goat-debug, etc.)
- Simple factual question → answer directly
- Trivial artifact (hotfix, single-file change) → use goat-review instead. If it's not worth 3 agents and 5 phases, don't use goat-sbao.

## Step 0 — Intake

Quick vs full mode (default: quick for Standard complexity):
- `/goat-sbao` or router: confirm artifact and choose quick (2 agents, no cross-exam) or full (3 agents).
- Quick: Agents B/C → Generate, Rank, Synthesise.
- Full: Agents A/B/C → 5 phases.
- Read relevant `.goat-flow/footguns/` and `.goat-flow/lessons/`.
- Skill-chained: skip intake confirmation; use caller context and start at Phase 1.

## Phase 1 — Generate Competing Critiques

Quick mode: spawn 2 sub-agents.
Full mode: spawn 3 sub-agents.

Context varies intentionally — informational diversity catches more than tonal diversity.

### The Core Trio Lens

Agents A and B both use the SKEPTIC/ANALYST/STRATEGIST combined lens. These three perspectives work as a unit — never split them into separate agents:

- **SKEPTIC** — "What could go wrong? What assumptions are unproven? What's the worst-case scenario?"
- **ANALYST** — "What does the evidence actually say? What's the cost/benefit? What do the numbers and code paths tell us?"
- **STRATEGIST** — "What's the fastest path to shipping? What can we defer? What's the highest-leverage change?"

All three perspectives must appear in every critique from Agents A and B. The tension between them is the point.

### Sub-Agent Definitions

**Sub-agent A:** artifact + architecture + footguns + lessons. Focus on risks and fastest safe path.
**Sub-agent B:** same context. Focus on alternatives and tradeoffs.
**Sub-agent C:** artifact + rubric only (fresh eyes). Flag assumption gaps and clarity issues.

Each sub-agent MUST return:
- 3-7 findings: title, severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), evidence (file:line or artifact section reference), confidence (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), one-sentence rationale
- Overall assessment: STRONG / ADEQUATE / WEAK / FLAWED
- One thing the artifact gets RIGHT that should be preserved

MUST use Agent tool calls, not inline role-play. Sub-agents run in isolated context.

## Phase 2 — Rank and Compare

Build a quick matrix and score by grounding/specificity/actionability/coverage/calibration.
Label each finding as consensus / split / unique.

**Control group delta:** For Agent C-only findings, mark each as CONTEXT DRIFT / READABILITY GAP / CONTEXT-LIMITED.

Quick mode: skip **Phase 3 (Cross-Examine)** and **Phase 4 (Clarify)**. Proceed directly to **Phase 5 (Synthesise)** after Phase 2.

## Phase 3 — Cross-Examine

For each split finding, spawn one more sub-agent: "Agent A says [X], Agent B says [Y]. Which is correct given the actual codebase?"

For unique HIGH/CRITICAL findings, spawn verification: "Only one critique raised [finding]. Genuine blind spot or false positive?"

Mark each: RESOLVED (with winner) / STILL DISPUTED / RETRACTED (false positive confirmed).

## Phase 4 — Clarify

Before synthesising, present the unresolved items to the human:

1. **Still-disputed findings** from Phase 3 — present both positions, ask which to adopt
2. **Material trade-offs** — where two valid approaches exist, present the fork and ask which path
3. **Context drift signals** — any CONTEXT DRIFT findings from Phase 2 that challenge the artifact's assumptions

Format:
> **Dispute [N]:** Agent A says [X], Agent B says [Y]. Cross-examination was inconclusive. Which position should the synthesis adopt?
> **Trade-off [N]:** [Option A] prioritises [X] at the cost of [Y]. [Option B] does the reverse. Which matters more here?
> **Context drift [N]:** Fresh eyes found [assumption]. Is this intentional or an oversight?

**If disputes exist or Decision Debt items need resolution:** BLOCKING GATE — STOP and present disputes for human resolution.
**If all agents agree (no disputes):** CHECKPOINT — note consensus and proceed to synthesis.

## Phase 5 — Synthesise

Produce the prime critique:
- Consensus findings (preserved as-is)
- Resolved split findings (with resolution rationale)
- Human-directed findings (from Phase 4 clarification responses)
- Verified unique findings (survived cross-examination)
- Retracted findings (listed so user sees what was considered and dismissed)

Tag low-confidence recommendations as Decision Debt with confidence level and revisit trigger.

**Blind spot check:** Before presenting, identify:
- Sections of the artifact that no sub-agent addressed
- Aspects of the critique rubric that no finding maps to
- Files or systems referenced by the artifact that were not read by any sub-agent

List these as "What Wasn't Critiqued." This section must never be empty — if everything was covered, state that explicitly.

**BLOCKING GATE:** Present the synthesised critique. Human decides: apply recommendations, dig deeper, re-run with different framing, or close. After critique of a plan, suggest `/goat-plan` to update milestones based on recommendations.

## Critique Rubrics

The rubric determines what sub-agents evaluate. Match to artifact type:

**Plan:** correctness against codebase, integration safety, sequencing quality, validation coverage, task specificity
**Security assessment:** threat model completeness, framework mitigation accuracy, exploitability calibration, data flow quality, attack surface coverage
**Debug hypotheses:** hypothesis diversity, evidence quality (OBSERVED vs INFERRED), elimination rigour, confidence calibration, reproduction completeness
**Review findings:** severity calibration, false positive rate, pre-existing separation, cross-reference impact, diff coverage
**Test strategy:** coverage gaps, doer-verifier separation, manual test specificity, mock awareness, risk-proportionate depth
**Architecture/refactor:** blast radius accuracy, migration safety, backward compatibility, dependency impact, rollback feasibility
**Generic (fallback):** internal consistency, evidence grounding, scope completeness, feasibility, risk identification. If using the generic rubric, state why no specific rubric matched and which was closest.

## Constraints

- Quick: 2 agents (B+C). Full: 3 agents (A+B+C).
- Quick mode runs 3 phases (Generate, Rank, Synthesise). Full mode runs 5.
- MUST use Agent tool calls for sub-agents, not inline role-play
- MUST isolate Phase 1 contexts
- MUST restrict Agent C (Fresh Eyes) to artifact + rubric only
- MUST use SKEPTIC/ANALYST/STRATEGIST as a combined lens per agent — never split into separate roles
- MUST differentiate Agent A (risk) from Agent B (alternatives) by instructions
- MUST flag control group delta: CONTEXT DRIFT / READABILITY GAP / CONTEXT-LIMITED for each unique Agent C finding
- MUST include critique rubric appropriate to artifact type
- MUST present consensus/split/unique classification for every finding
- Full mode only: MUST cross-examine split findings and unique HIGH/CRITICAL findings (Phase 3)
- Full mode only: MUST gate on unresolved disputes before synthesis (Phase 4)
- MUST tag low-confidence recommendations as Decision Debt
- MUST always include "What Wasn't Critiqued"
- Universal constraints from skill-preamble.md apply.
- MUST NOT auto-apply recommendations — human gate required
- Sub-agent budget: max 5 tool calls per sub-agent in Phase 1, max 3 in cross-examination
- Skill-chained: skip confirmation, still run footgun/lesson checks and rubric selection
