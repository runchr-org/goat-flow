**Symptoms:** A file that existed at the destination path is silently overwritten and its content is permanently lost. Especially dangerous for untracked files that have no git recovery path.

**Why it happens:** `mv src dest` and `cp src dest` overwrite `dest` without warning if it already exists. The Write tool does the same. Agents treat rename/move as a single command without checking the destination. If the user then asks to "undo", the agent moves the overwritten content back to the source path - destroying the original destination content entirely.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/roadmaps/TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` → overwritten by `mv TODO_improvements_v0.3.md TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` (2026-03-21). The file was untracked and unrecoverable through git.

**Prevention:**
- Before ANY `mv`, `cp`, or Write to an existing path: run `ls` on the destination first
- If the destination exists, STOP and ask the user before proceeding
- For `mv`: use `mv -n` (no-clobber) instead of bare `mv`
- This is a Never-tier rule - overwriting a file the user didn't ask to overwrite is data destruction
