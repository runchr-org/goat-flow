# Skill Quality Config

goat-flow ships a zero-config skill-quality rubric. Consumer projects can override parts of it through `.goat-flow/config.yaml` under `quality:` without editing `workflow/manifest.json`.

Use config only when the project has real conventions that differ from goat-flow defaults: custom artifact roots, different verification-gate vocabulary, project-specific subtype profiles, or extra fixture corpora.

## Minimal Example

```yaml
# .goat-flow/config.yaml
quality:
  gate-vocabulary:
    verification-gate:
      - BLOCKING GATE
      - Release Gate
      - SLO Gate
  additional-fixtures:
    - test/fixtures/skill-quality/team-expected-scores.json
```

With no `quality:` block, the default rubric is unchanged.

## Custom Subtype

Declare a subtype when the project has a repeatable artifact shape that is neither a normal workflow skill nor a reference playbook.

```yaml
quality:
  subtypes:
    audit:
      detection:
        kinds:
          - skill
        headings:
          - "^## Audit Mode\\b"
        must-not-have:
          - "^## Step 0\\b"
        name-patterns: []
      profile:
        trigger-clarity: 15
        workflow-completeness: 5
        gate-quality: 10
        evidence-testability: 10
        cold-start: 10
        token-cost: 10
        tool-deps: 5
        write-risk: 0
        skill-reference-fit: 10
      notes: "Audit-only skills score like reports but use a domain-specific Audit Mode marker."
```

Subtype detection contributes to the classification confidence shown in the dashboard. A high structure score with low confidence returns `consider-reclassifying`.

## Supported Keys

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `walk-roots.skills` | Skill directories to inventory. |
| `walk-roots.references` | Reference directories to inventory. |
| `composition` | Shared preamble/conventions paths, skill-reference regex, and composed byte cap. |
| `gate-vocabulary` | Regex sources for verification gates, explicit pass/fail language, and human-stop language. |
| `tool-keywords` | Tokens that indicate external tool dependencies. |
| `subtypes` | Detection rules, metric profile caps, and notes for artifact subtypes. |
| `fixture-path` | Primary expected-score fixture for the current project. |
| `additional-fixtures` | Extra expected-score fixtures for consumer corpora. |

## Guardrails

- Keep config project-scoped. Do not store consumer overrides in `workflow/manifest.json`.
- Add a fixture when changing subtype profiles so score drift is intentional.
- Prefer extending defaults. Replace defaults only when the project convention is incompatible.
- Avoid brittle provider-specific regexes unless a real project artifact needs them.

## Verification

Run the focused tests after config changes:

```bash
node --import tsx --test test/unit/quality-config.test.ts
node --import tsx --test test/unit/skill-quality.test.ts
```
