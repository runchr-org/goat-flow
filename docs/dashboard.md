# Dashboard Reference

Launch: `npx goat-flow dashboard .` (or `npx goat-flow dashboard . --dev` for live reload)

## Local Access Boundary

The dashboard is a local privileged control plane. Each server process prints a URL containing an ephemeral token, injects that token into the browser boot payload, and clears it from the visible address bar after load. All `/api/*` requests and `/ws/terminal/:id` attaches require the current token; side-effectful HTTP routes also reject browser requests whose `Origin` is not the dashboard's own localhost origin. The token is process-local only and must not be written to dashboard state, terminal session metadata, localStorage, or PTY environment.

Read-only browsing and audit routes may still inspect arbitrary local paths selected in the UI after token authorization. Side-effectful routes are guarded by the same token boundary, and terminal creation still validates that the requested project path is an existing directory.

Successful dashboard operations append redacted evidence-envelope records to
`.goat-flow/logs/events/*.jsonl`. The trace records metadata such as terminal
creation, prompt launch/send, audit runs, setup/quality prompt generation, and
project list changes without storing full prompt text, terminal scrollback, or
uploaded file contents. Inspect it with `goat-flow events tail . --limit 20`.

## Views

The dashboard uses a persistent desktop side rail for primary navigation. The
rail collapses to icon-only with hover tooltips, exposes an active-plan tooltip
when collapsed, and keeps Projects, Prompts, and New Prompt grouped together.
The header stays focused on the current project switcher, runner switcher, and
utility actions. The 1.7.0 release scopes the rail to backed destinations only:
Home, Prompts, Workspace, Skill Evaluator, Plans, Projects, Quality, and Setup.
Dedicated harness and manager pages are deferred to 1.8.0.

### Home

Overview landing page. Shows an active-sessions strip, a four-pill rollup for install, harness, learning-loop, and quality status, plus a priority-driven Next Action card based on the latest audit and quality history. The agent grid compares harness health across supported agents and expands per-agent details, including an advisory enforcement matrix for hard, limited, soft, missing, and unknown local enforcement evidence. The lower row summarizes install state with a health ring and lists recent lesson entries. Run a new audit or re-audit after changes without leaving the page; the healthy state still presents a Next Action card rather than replacing actions with a banner.

### Tasks

Plans milestone browser for the selected project (route ID `tasks`; the side
rail labels it "Plans"). Surfaces `.goat-flow/tasks/` plan directories,
milestone status, and checkbox progress. The plan list can update
`.goat-flow/tasks/.active` for the selected project. The `/api/tasks` backing
endpoint and on-disk `.goat-flow/tasks/` directory keep their original names.

### Coming Soon

Placeholder destination for menu items whose feature pages are deferred to
1.8.0 (dedicated harness and manager pages). Renders a lightweight Coming Soon
view rather than a disabled menu item.

### Quality

Generate and view agent quality-assessment prompts. Select a target agent, generate the prompt, and preview the full output with embedded audit results.

### Setup

Guided setup flow. Detects your project stack and existing configuration, lets you pick a target agent from the manifest-backed registry, then generates a setup prompt you can preview and launch directly in a terminal session.

### Skills

Per-artifact quality view for installed skills and shared references. Shows deterministic structural scores, warning counts, subtype-aware metric profiles, and a detail panel for inspecting one artifact at a time. Use `Re-audit all` to refresh the cached scores or `Evaluate skill` to inspect uploaded skill/reference content before installing it.

### Projects

Multi-project browser. Lists registered projects with their latest audit status. Project titles and favorites follow a stable identity when possible: git remote hash first, then a local `.goat-flow/project-id` marker for non-git goat-flow projects, then absolute path fallback. The marker is local dashboard state and remains gitignored by the default `.goat-flow/.gitignore`. "Audit All" re-audits every project in one click. Select a project to switch context and view its results on the Home view.

### Prompts

Dedicated prompt library. Two-pane layout: left pane is the list with search, category filters, favorites strip, and grouped-by-category rendering; right pane is the full prompt preview with search-match highlighting. Primary actions are `Copy`, `Launch in new terminal`, and `Send to active terminal` -- the last one is project-scoped and only appears when one or more active sessions exist for the current project (a picker is shown when multiple). Keyboard: `/` focuses search, `↑` / `↓` navigate, `Enter` launches the selected prompt, `Esc` clears the search or selection.

Good default presets to start with:

- `Debug UI in Browser` routes to `/goat-debug` and diagnoses browser-visible bugs with live browser evidence. It checks for `browser-use`, asks for the URL and symptom, captures page state and screenshots, then maps the evidence back to source before proposing a fix.
- `Fix Bug` runs `/goat-debug` from diagnosis through a minimal fix and post-fix verification.
- `Review Uncommitted` runs `/goat-review` as a pre-commit gate for MUST-level findings only.
- `Pre Walk-Through with Draft Targeted Testing` turns a PR and issue into reviewer questions plus targeted local UI test tasks.
- `Test Plan vs Code Changes` compares a proposed test plan against the actual diff and calls out coverage gaps.
- `Break Into Milestones` turns a feature brief into testable `/goat-plan` milestones.
- `Security Assessment` runs a full `/goat-security` threat assessment across the repo, runtime surface, and dependencies.

### Workspace

Split layout focused on terminal work. The left **Sessions rail** lists all running terminal sessions (up to 10) grouped by current project first then other projects, with single-click session switching, runner/age/idle/detached indicators, inline-confirm `End`, an `End all` footer, and a `+ New session` shortcut that jumps to Prompts. The right pane is the active xterm.js terminal. The rail uses `x-transition` on collapse/expand, supports collapsed-state tooltips, and exposes per-agent class hooks plus an active-session pip with status tone for accessibility. Drag and drop images onto the terminal pane to attach them to the next prompt (uploads go through `/api/terminal/:id/upload-image`).

### Settings

Configuration view. Manage registered project paths, dashboard preferences, and agent runtime settings.

### About

Getting-started page for new users. Explains what goat-flow is, the audit/quality model, what skills and hooks do, the learning loop, and the execution loop. Accessible from the side menu or the header "?" button.

## Terminal

- Supports runners from `workflow/manifest.json`; terminal binary names, setup surfaces, and prompt invocation style are injected from the manifest-backed agent registry
- WebSocket-based PTY sessions via xterm.js
- 480-minute idle timeout (8 hours) with auto-kill
- Maximum 10 concurrent sessions
- Session state: running / ended / error

## Design ethos: utilitarian, not decorative

The dashboard is a local operations console for AI coding workflows, not a landing page or marketing surface. When adding or changing UI, run through this anti-convergence checklist before declaring done. Apply only the parts that fit a utilitarian operations tool.

- **Purpose** — what operational decision does this view support? If it has no decision, it is documentation; consider whether it belongs in `docs/` instead.
- **Density** — every panel earns its space. Default to a denser layout than a typical SaaS landing page; whitespace is for separating noisy regions, not framing single elements.
- **Scannability** — operators arrive mid-task. Place the highest-signal data top-left, and use letter grades, badges, or counts before paragraphs.
- **Differentiation** — the dashboard's job is to surface goat-flow's audit/harness/quality state. Generic AI-assistant UI patterns (chat bubbles, animated typing, illustrative empty states) usually pull the eye away from that data.
- **Tone** — neutral, technical, lower-case status words ("audited just now", "12 skills audited"). Avoid celebratory copy ("Awesome!", "All set!") and apology copy ("Oops!").
- **Constraints** — `.gf-*` CSS classes, theme variables (`--surface-base`, `--surface-elevated`, `--text-primary`), and Alpine for interactivity. No new heavy dependencies, no decorative motion, no framework swap "while we're in here".
- **Typography / colour / motion fit** — typography is monospace-leaning for evidence, sans-serif for status; colour is reserved for severity (`is-a`/`is-b`/.../`is-f`, `is-low`); motion is restricted to load spinners and disabled-button feedback. Anything else needs a justification tied to an operator decision.

When in doubt, look at the Skills page or the Home view as the reference shape — both are operations-first. Imitate them; do not import a marketing-site shape.
