# Dashboard Reference

Launch: `goat-flow dashboard .` (or `goat-flow dashboard . --dev` for live reload)

## Views

### Home

Overview landing page. Shows "What to do next" action cards based on your latest audit results, per-agent status indicators, and quick-launch buttons for the setup wizard and terminal. Full audit results render inline on this page: each scope (GOAT Flow Setup, Agent Setup, AI Harness Completeness) shows pass/fail status and can be expanded for details, with per-agent cards and actionable fix instructions. Run a new audit or re-audit after changes without leaving the page. When all agents pass audit, the action cards are replaced with a success banner.

### Quality

Generate and view agent quality-assessment prompts. Select a target agent, generate the prompt, and preview the full output with embedded audit results.

### Setup

Guided setup flow. Detects your project stack and existing configuration, lets you pick a target agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini), then generates a setup prompt you can preview and launch directly in a terminal session.

### Projects

Multi-project browser. Lists all registered project paths with their latest audit status. "Audit All" re-audits every project in one click. Select a project to switch context and view its results on the Home view.

### Prompts

Dedicated prompt library. Two-pane layout: left pane is the list with search, category filters, favorites strip, and grouped-by-category rendering; right pane is the full prompt preview with search-match highlighting. Primary actions are `Copy`, `Launch in new terminal`, and `Send to active terminal` -- the last one is project-scoped and only appears when one or more active sessions exist for the current project (a picker is shown when multiple). Keyboard: `/` focuses search, `↑` / `↓` navigate, `Enter` launches the selected prompt, `Esc` clears the search or selection.

### Workspace

Split layout focused on terminal work. The left **Sessions rail** lists all running terminal sessions (up to 7) grouped by current project first then other projects, with single-click session switching, runner/age/idle/detached indicators, inline-confirm `End`, an `End all` footer, and a `+ New session` shortcut that jumps to Prompts. The right pane is the active xterm.js terminal. The rail uses `x-transition` on collapse/expand.

### Settings

Configuration view. Manage registered project paths, dashboard preferences, and agent runtime settings.

### Help

Getting-started page for new users. Explains what goat-flow is, the audit/quality model, what skills and hooks do, the learning loop, and the execution loop. Accessible from the "?" button in the nav bar.
