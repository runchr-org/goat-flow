# Footguns

Cross-domain gotchas confirmed in this codebase. Add entries only when the repo itself demonstrates the behaviour. Every entry MUST include file:line evidence.

## Footgun: Cross-reference fragility across docs

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A renamed or moved file breaks links in multiple documents. Users following getting-started.md hit dead references.

**Why it happens:** Documentation files reference each other by relative path. The project has 60+ markdown files with dense cross-referencing. Renaming one file can break references in 5-10 others.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/getting-started.md:162` → references `workflow/_reference/system-spec.md` (stale path, file is at `docs/system-spec.md`)
- `docs/getting-started.md:163` → references `workflow/_draft/00-1-ai-workflow-ARTICLE-prime_v1.5.md`
- `docs/getting-started.md:15` → references `workflow/_draft/00-1-ai-workflow-ARTICLE-prime_v1.5.md`
- `docs/system/five-layers.md:274` → references `FIVE_LAYER_SYSTEM.md` (old filename)

**Prevention:** After any file rename or move, grep the entire repo for the old path. Use `grep -r "old-filename" --include="*.md"` before declaring done. This is DoD gate #6.

## Footgun: Concept duplication across core docs

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A user reads conflicting descriptions of the same concept in different files. An agent follows a rule from one file that contradicts another.

**Why it happens:** The execution loop, autonomy tiers, anti-pattern table, and other core concepts are described in `docs/system-spec.md`, `docs/system/six-steps.md`, `docs/system/five-layers.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, and `docs/reference/design-rationale.md`. Updating one without updating the others creates drift.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/system-spec.md:126` → execution loop definition
- `docs/system/six-steps.md:7` → execution loop definition (detailed version)
- `docs/getting-started.md:10` → execution loop summary
- `docs/reference/design-rationale.md:194` → execution loop rationale with repeated content

**Prevention:** When editing a core concept, grep for the concept name across all docs and update every occurrence. `docs/system-spec.md` is the canonical source of truth.

## Footgun: Line target inconsistency for project shapes (RESOLVED)

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Status:** RESOLVED - unified to 120 lines for all project shapes in v0.1.1. The original 100/120 split was dropped after real implementations showed every project with the 6-step loop, budgets, and all required sections lands in the 100-120 range regardless of shape.

**Prevention:** Line target is 120 for all shapes, stated in `docs/system-spec.md:104`. If this number appears differently in any other file, the spec is canonical.

## Footgun: Setup instructions contradict spec on execution loop steps

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** Agents implementing GOAT Flow produce a CLAUDE.md with the old 5-step loop (READ → CLASSIFY → ACT → VERIFY → LOG), missing SCOPE and complexity budgets. Cascades into missing sections (f)-(g) because agents under line pressure cut what the spec doesn't reinforce.

**Why it happens:** `setup/setup-claude.md` tells agents to "Read docs/system-spec.md" FIRST. If system-spec.md shows a different loop than `setup/shared/execution-loop.md`, agents absorb whichever they read first and can't reconcile the contradiction. This caused 7 of 8 gaps in the sus-form-detector implementation.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/system-spec.md:15` → loop definition in Layer 1 architecture diagram
- `docs/system-spec.md:126` → loop definition in execution loop section
- `setup/shared/execution-loop.md:14` → updated loop definition (authoritative)
- `setup/setup-claude.md:43` → "Read docs/system-spec.md" as first instruction

**Prevention:** After updating `setup/shared/execution-loop.md`, ALWAYS update the same concept in `docs/system-spec.md`, `docs/system/six-steps.md`, and `docs/system/five-layers.md`. The spec is read first by agents - it must match. This is a specific instance of the "concept duplication" footgun above, but critical enough to track separately because it directly causes broken implementations.

## Footgun: Stale references from old project structure

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** Settings, paths, or documentation reference `ai-workflow-framework` (the old project name) instead of `goat-flow`.

**Why it happens:** The project was renamed from `ai-workflow-framework` to `goat-flow`. Not all references were updated.

**Evidence:**
- `.claude/settings.local.json` → contained absolute paths referencing the old project name (file is gitignored, not tracked)

**Prevention:** After any project-level rename, run `grep -r "old-name" --include="*.md" --include="*.json"` across the entire repo.

## Footgun: Agent rewrites shared docs with agent-specific vocabulary

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** Shared documentation files (`docs/`, `workflow/`) contain references to only one agent's hook names, paths, or terminology. Other agents reading these docs get incorrect instructions. Tables lose rows for other agents.

**Why it happens:** When an agent is asked to set up or update its platform support, it replaces existing references wholesale instead of adding multi-agent support. The agent treats the task as find-and-replace: `.claude/` → `.gemini/`, `PreToolUse` → `BeforeTool`, "Every Claude turn" → "Every Gemini turn". It does not distinguish between agent-specific files (`setup/setup-gemini.md`) and shared files (`docs/system-spec.md`).

**Evidence:**
- `docs/system-spec.md:429` → "Every Gemini turn" replaced "Every Claude turn" (should be agent-neutral)
- `docs/system/five-layers.md:100` → Claude Code row deleted from skills table, replaced with Gemini CLI only
- `docs/system/five-layers.md:49-50` → `.gemini/settings.json` replaced `.claude/` equivalents
- `docs/system/six-steps.md:182` → Claude Code hook example replaced with Gemini, not added alongside
- `workflow/runtime/enforcement.md` → all `.claude/` paths replaced with `.gemini/`, creating hybrid state

**Prevention:**
- Agent-specific files (`setup/setup-*.md`, `.claude/`, `.gemini/`) - edits fine
- Shared docs (`docs/`, `workflow/`) - MUST remain agent-neutral or list all agents
- When adding agent support: ADD to tables and examples, never DELETE or REPLACE existing agent references
- Setup prompts MUST include explicit scope constraints: "Do NOT modify files outside `.gemini/` and `GEMINI.md`"

## Footgun: Multi-agent setup files share structure but not vocabulary

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** Gemini CLI rejects hook event names with "Invalid hook event name" warnings. Hooks silently don't run. Users get a working `.claude/` setup but broken `.gemini/` setup from the same instructions.

**Why it happens:** `setup/setup-gemini.md` was derived from `setup/setup-claude.md` by substituting paths (`.claude/` → `.gemini/`, `CLAUDE.md` → `GEMINI.md`) but CLI-specific vocabulary wasn't translated. Each CLI uses different hook event names:
- Claude Code: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`
- Gemini CLI: `BeforeTool`, `AfterTool`, `AfterAgent`, `SessionEnd`

Hook script comments also carried over Claude-specific language ("runs after every Claude turn").

**Evidence:**
- `setup/setup-gemini.md:188-193` → now has Gemini CLI event reference block (fix applied 2026-03-21)
- `.gemini/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh:2` → updated to "BeforeTool hook" (fixed 2026-03-21)
- `.gemini/hooks/stop-lint.sh:2` → updated to "AfterAgent hook" (fixed 2026-03-21)
- `.gemini/settings.json:14,25` → updated to `BeforeTool` and `AfterAgent` event names (fixed 2026-03-21)

**Prevention:** When creating or updating a setup file for a new CLI, diff it against the source file and check every CLI-specific term - not just paths. Maintain the event name reference block at the top of each CLI's Phase 1c section.

## Footgun: mv/cp/Write overwrites existing files without checking

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** A file that existed at the destination path is silently overwritten and its content is permanently lost. Especially dangerous for untracked files that have no git recovery path.

**Why it happens:** `mv src dest` and `cp src dest` overwrite `dest` without warning if it already exists. The Write tool does the same. Agents treat rename/move as a single command without checking the destination. If the user then asks to "undo", the agent moves the overwritten content back to the source path - destroying the original destination content entirely.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/roadmaps/TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` → overwritten by `mv TODO_improvements_v0.3.md TODO_improvements_v0.4.md` (2026-03-21). The file was untracked and unrecoverable through git. Required extraction from Claude conversation logs to partially recover.

**Prevention:**
- Before ANY `mv`, `cp`, or Write to an existing path: run `ls` on the destination first
- If the destination exists, STOP and ask the user before proceeding
- For `mv`: use `mv -n` (no-clobber) instead of bare `mv`
- This is a Never-tier rule - overwriting a file the user didn't ask to overwrite is data destruction

## Footgun: Deduplicated multi-agent setup drifts from per-agent setup rules

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** `goat-flow setup . --agent all` emits a single deduplicated setup prompt that looks shorter and cleaner than per-agent setup, but it can direct users to scaffold shared skills in the wrong directory, flatten phase-specific guidance into one generic reference, and skip template validation entirely.

**Why it happens:** `composeMultiAgentSetup()` rebuilds the full-setup output as a separate code path instead of reusing the single-agent phase rendering. Its shared table is derived from the first agent's standard refs, so Claude's `.claude/skills/` path leaks into a multi-agent prompt even though shared multi-agent skills are supposed to canonicalize under `.agents/skills/`. The same path also replaces per-phase agent-specific guidance and validation with one final gate.

**Evidence:**
- `src/cli/cli.ts:205` → routes multi-agent full setup through `composeMultiAgentSetup()`
- `src/cli/prompt/compose-setup.ts:399` → builds shared refs from the first agent only
- `src/cli/prompt/template-refs.ts:151` → skill output path is derived from `p.skillsDir`
- `src/cli/detect/agents.ts:8` → Claude profile sets `skillsDir: '.claude/skills'`
- `setup/shared/docs-seed.md:106` → multi-agent projects should canonicalize skills in `.agents/skills/`
- `src/cli/prompt/compose-setup.ts:441` → emits one bare "Agent-specific setup" line per agent
- `src/cli/prompt/compose-setup.ts:448` → collapses setup to one final scan gate
- `src/cli/prompt/compose-setup.ts:262` → template validation exists only in the single-agent full setup path

**Prevention:** When adding a condensed or multi-agent output mode, preserve the same invariants as the single-agent path: canonical shared output paths, per-phase agent-specific guidance, and the same template validation gates. If a new setup mode cannot reuse those invariants directly, treat it as a high-risk integration path and audit its rendered output before release.

## Footgun: Eval templates, parser, and scanner drift out of contract

**Evidence type:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

**Symptoms:** An eval written exactly from the shipped template can fail the scanner, or a valid eval heading accepted by the parser can still fail the rubric. Users create evals that look correct in markdown but lose points in `goat-flow scan`.

**Why it happens:** Eval structure is defined in three places with different assumptions:
- `workflow/evaluation/evals.md` tells users what to write
- `src/cli/evals/parser.ts` decides which headings are semantically equivalent
- `src/cli/facts/shared.ts` performs strict regex checks for the rubric

When one of those changes without the others, the setup guidance stops matching the scan logic.

**Evidence:**
- `workflow/evaluation/evals.md:46` → template tells users to create an `## Origin` section
- `src/cli/facts/shared.ts:118` → scanner only accepts `**Origin:**` labels
- `src/cli/facts/shared.ts:119` → scanner only accepts `## Replay Prompt`
- `src/cli/evals/parser.ts:246` → parser already treats `Scenario` as equivalent to `Replay Prompt`
- `workflow/evaluation/evals.md:78` → example opens with an outer ```markdown fence
- `workflow/evaluation/evals.md:88` → example nests inner triple-backtick fences, which breaks standard markdown rendering

**Prevention:** Treat eval shape as a single contract. Any change to allowed headings, label format, or example structure must be updated in the template, parser, and scanner together. Verify with one round-trip test: write an eval from the template, parse it, then confirm it passes the full-tier scan checks.
