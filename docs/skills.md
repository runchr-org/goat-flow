# Skills

Seven focused capabilities (six plus dispatcher) loaded on demand. Each skill has a distinct artifact, a hard quality gate, and a repeatable output. Skills don't load unless invoked - they stay out of the instruction budget.

All skills use the `goat-` prefix to avoid conflicts with built-in agent commands.

```

| Skill | Purpose | Hard Gate | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| [/goat](#goat--dispatcher) | Route to the right skill | -- | Always (convenience layer) |
| [/goat-debug](#goat-debug) | Diagnosis-first debugging + investigate mode | No fixes until human reviews diagnosis | Bug or test failure, exploring unfamiliar code |
| [/goat-plan](#goat-plan) | Milestone planning with testing gates | Human approval between milestones | Before non-trivial implementation |
| [/goat-review](#goat-review) | Structured code review + quality audit | MUST read all files before commenting | Before merging, quality audits |
| [/goat-critique](#goat-critique) | Multi-perspective critique of any artifact | Disputes resolved before synthesis | High-stakes decisions, plans, assessments |
| [/goat-security](#goat-security) | Threat-model-driven security assessment | MUST rank findings by exploitability | Before releases, after dependency changes, during audits |
| [/goat-qa](#goat-qa) | Testing gap analysis and verification planning | Does not run or write tests; generates gap analysis and testing plan | After a milestone or 30-60 min of coding |

## Choosing the Right Skill

| Situation | Skill | Why not the others |
|-----------|-------|--------------------|
| "Are there security issues?" | /goat-security | Threat-model-driven scan with framework verification |
| "This test is failing, why?" | /goat-debug | Need diagnosis before fixing |
| "How healthy is this module?" | /goat-review (audit mode) | Systematic scan, not a single bug |
| "How does this subsystem work?" | /goat-debug (investigate mode) | Understanding before changing |
| "I'm new to this project" | /goat-debug (investigate mode) | Progressive depth reading + orientation |
| "How should we build this feature?" | /goat-plan | Planning before implementing |
| "Are these changes safe to merge?" | /goat-review | Reviewing changes, not finding new issues |
| "How do we verify this work?" | /goat-qa | Risk-based testing gap analysis |
| "Is this plan/assessment sound?" | /goat-critique | Multi-perspective critique before shipping |

## /goat - Dispatcher

Route to the right skill in one step. Type `/goat` followed by what you need.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Input["User input"] --> Understand["Classify intent"]
    Understand --> Gather["Gather context\nAsk First boundaries\nFootgun matches\nRecent git"]
    Gather --> Route{"Route to\nskill"}
    Route --> Announce["Announce: Routing to /goat-X\nOne-line rationale"]
    Announce --> Execute["Load target skill's Step 0"]
```

The dispatcher classifies intent conversationally - not by keyword lookup. It asks 0-2 clarification questions max and routes with a stated assumption if still ambiguous.

| Intent | Skill |
|--------|-------|
| Bug, error, symptom, crash | /goat-debug (diagnose) |
| Explore, understand, new to this | /goat-debug (investigate) |
| Review changes, PR, diff | /goat-review (quick review) |
| Quality sweep, audit | /goat-review (audit) |
| Security, vulnerability, compliance | /goat-security |
| Plan, design, build a feature | /goat-plan (via Planning Route) |
| Test gaps, coverage, verify | /goat-qa |
| Critique a plan/assessment | /goat-critique |

**Planning Route:** For planning requests, the dispatcher checks `.goat-flow/tasks/` for existing plans first, then routes based on complexity: Hotfix → direct execution; Small Feature → compressed brief → `/goat-plan`; Standard → feature brief → `/goat-plan`; System/Infrastructure → feature brief → `/goat-plan` → suggest `/goat-critique`.

## /goat-debug

Diagnosis-first debugging and codebase investigation.

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Diagnose** | bug, error, crash, symptom | Hypothesis-driven debugging with confidence-gated fixes |
| **Investigate** | explore, understand, how does, new to this | Deep codebase reading with progressive depth and evidence tags |

**Diagnose mode:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0\nGather context\nFootgun check"] --> D1

    subgraph Diagnose["Diagnose Mode"]
        D1["D1: Investigate\nHypotheses (2+ categories)\nTrace code paths"] --> D2
        D2["D2: Diagnosis\nConfidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW"]
    end

    D2 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| Decision{Human decision}
    Decision -->|"Fix it"| D3["D3: Fix Plan"]
    Decision -->|"Go deeper"| D1
    Decision -->|"Just report"| Close
    D3 --> D4["D4: Post-Fix Verification"]
    D4 -->|"CHECKPOINT"| Close["Closing\nLearning loop"]
```

No fixes until human reviews diagnosis. Confidence levels: HIGH = reproduced, MEDIUM = traced but not reproduced, LOW = inferred from code reading.

**Investigate mode:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0\nGather context"] --> I1

    subgraph Investigate["Investigate Mode"]
        I1["I1: Scope & Plan\nDeclare in/out of scope\nRead estimate"]
        I1 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| I2["I2: Read (Progressive Depth)\nEntry points → Critical path → Supporting"]
        I2 -->|"3x estimate?"| Check{"Re-scope?"}
        Check -->|Yes| I1
        Check -->|No| I3["I3: Report\n'What I Didn't Read' (required)"]
    end

    I3 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| Close["Go deeper / Switch to diagnose / Close"]
```

For onboarding ("I'm new to this project"), use investigate mode - covers stack detection and codebase orientation through progressive depth reading.

---

## /goat-plan

Milestone task file generator and manager. Creates structured milestone files in `.goat-flow/tasks/` that track progress, enforce testing gates, and provide local working state for the current session.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0\nCheck existing milestones\nIdentify riskiest part\nKill criteria"] --> P1

    subgraph Plan["Milestone Breakdown"]
        P1["Phase 1: Break into milestones\nArchetypes: Prove It Works → Make It Real\n→ Make It Solid → Make It Shine"]
    end

    P1 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| P2["Phase 2: Write milestone files\nto .goat-flow/tasks/"]
    P2 -->|"CHECKPOINT"| P3["Phase 3: Between milestones\nRun testing gate\nCapture learnings\nUpdate next milestone"]
    P3 -->|"CHECKPOINT"| Next{"Next milestone?"}
    Next -->|Yes| P3
    Next -->|No| Close["Complete"]
```

**Milestone archetypes:** Prove It Works (spike the riskiest part first) → Make It Real (end-to-end working) → Make It Solid (edge cases, security) → Make It Shine (polish, optional). Each milestone has kill criteria, assumption tracking, and a testing gate before the next begins. For Hotfix/Small Feature scope, milestones can be delivered inline rather than written to files.

**Key constraints:** MUST check for existing milestone files before creating new ones. MUST include testing gates on every milestone. MUST NOT continue building on an invalidated assumption.

---

## /goat-review

Structured code review and quality audit with negative verification.

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Quick Review** | review, PR, diff | Severity-ordered scan of changes with negative verification |
| **Audit** | audit, quality sweep | Systematic codebase area scan - findings only, no fixes |

**Quick Review:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0\nAuto-detect scope\nFootgun check"] --> R1

    subgraph Review["Quick Review"]
        R1["Severity-Ordered Scan\nSecurity > Correctness > Integration > Performance > Style"]
        R1 --> R2["Negative Verification\nAttempt to DISPROVE each finding\nRemove false positives"]
        R2 --> R3["Present Findings\nMUST / SHOULD / MAY Fix"]
    end

    R3 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| DoD["DoD Gate Check"]
    DoD -->|"CHECKPOINT"| Close["Closing"]
```

MUST NOT flag pre-existing issues as part of this change. MUST attempt to disprove each finding before presenting it.

**Audit mode:** For codebase areas (not a diff). Scan using severity ordering, run negative verification, group 3+ related findings as systemic patterns. MUST NOT propose fixes in audit mode - findings only.

---

## /goat-critique

Multi-perspective critique using sub-agent orchestration. Takes any concrete artifact (plan, security assessment, debug hypothesis set, review findings, architecture proposal) and generates competing analyses from multiple perspectives.

| Mode | When | Agents | Phases |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| **Quick** (default) | Standard complexity, 1-10 files affected | 2 (Alternatives + Fresh Eyes) | 3: Generate → Rank → Synthesise |
| **Full** | System/Infrastructure complexity, security-critical, 10+ files | 3 (Risk + Alternatives + Fresh Eyes) | 5: Generate → Rank → Cross-Examine → Clarify → Synthesise |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0\nStake calibration\nChoose quick/full"] --> P1

    subgraph Generate["Phase 1: Generate"]
        A["Agent A (Risk Focus)\nSKEPTIC/ANALYST/STRATEGIST\n+ footguns + lessons"]
        B["Agent B (Alternatives Focus)\nSKEPTIC/ANALYST/STRATEGIST\n+ git history + config"]
        C["Agent C (Fresh Eyes)\nArtifact + evaluation criteria ONLY\nNo project context"]
    end

    P1 --> Generate
    Generate --> P2["Phase 2: Rank & Compare\nConsensus / Split / Unique"]
    P2 --> P3["Phase 3: Cross-Examine\nSplit findings get a tiebreaker agent"]
    P3 --> P4["Phase 4: Clarify\nPresent disputes to human"]
    P4 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| P5["Phase 5: Synthesise\nConsensus + Resolved + Verified + Retracted\n+ Decision Debt + What Wasn't Critiqued"]
```

Quick mode skips Phases 3 and 4 - goes directly from Rank to Synthesise.

**Key constraints:** MUST use Agent tool calls for sub-agents, not inline role-play. MUST restrict Agent C to artifact + evaluation criteria only (no project context). MUST include "What Wasn't Critiqued" section (never empty). MUST tag low-confidence recommendations as Decision Debt.

---

## /goat-security

Threat-model-driven security assessment with framework-aware verification.

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Threat model** | security, vulnerability, OWASP | Full threat surface scan with exploitability ranking |
| **Dependency audit** | dependencies, CVEs, supply chain | Focused dependency vulnerability scan |
| **Compliance** | HIPAA, GDPR, compliance | Regulation-specific controls assessment |

**Threat model mode:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0\nFramework auto-detect\nFootgun check"] --> P1

    subgraph ThreatModel["Threat Model Mode"]
        P1["Phase 1: Threat Surface Scan\n10-category checklist\nSkip irrelevant categories"]
        P1 --> P2["Phase 2: Framework-Aware Verification\nFor each finding, check:\n(a) installed? (b) configured? (c) applied?"]
    end

    P2 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| P3["Phase 3: Exploitability Ranking\nCritical → High → Medium → Low\nAttack scenario for each"]
    P3 --> P4["Phase 4: Self-Check\nRe-read cited code\nRemove unverified findings"]
    P4 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| Close["Present final report"]
```

MUST check framework built-in mitigations before flagging. A finding mitigated by the framework's defaults is a false positive, not a finding. Confidence classification: CONFIRMED (entry-to-sink traced), PROBABLE (plausible, missing source trace), THEORETICAL (policy gap, no exploit path).

| Framework | Check these mitigations first |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Laravel | CSRF middleware, mass assignment protection, Eloquent parameterization |
| Django | CSRF middleware, ORM parameterization, `SECRET_KEY` rotation |
| Express | Helmet headers, rate limiting, CORS configuration |
| Spring | Spring Security filters, CSRF protection, parameter binding |
| Go | `html/template` auto-escaping, `crypto/rand`, HTTP client timeouts |

---

## /goat-qa

Testing gap analyser. Compares code changes against testing coverage to find undertested risks and misaligned test effort. Does not write test code - hands off to the coding agent.

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Standard** | test, verify, gaps | Risk-based gap analysis for recent changes |
| **Audit** | test audit, coverage | Audit existing test coverage for a codebase area |
| **Regression Guard** | after bug fix | Define invariants and assess coverage for a specific fix |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0\nGather scope\nConfirm mode"] --> P1

    subgraph GapAnalysis["Gap Analysis"]
        P1["Phase 1: Change Risk Map\nRead actual diff, not just file names\nClassify: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW\nTrace blast radius for CRITICAL/HIGH"]
        P1 -->|"CHECKPOINT"| P2["Phase 2: Gap Analysis\nCompare risk vs coverage\nUndertested risks + Misaligned effort"]
        P2 -->|"BLOCKING GATE"| P3["Phase 3: Targeted Testing Plan\nMust test / Should test / Safe to skip\nTime estimates for manual items"]
    end

    P3 -->|"CHECKPOINT"| Close["Closing"]
```

## Shared Conventions

Every skill shares:
- **Step 0** - context gathering before any work begins
- **BLOCKING GATEs** - agent stops and waits for human decision
- **CHECKPOINTs** - agent reports status and continues unless interrupted
- **Footgun check** - cross-reference `.goat-flow/footguns/` for known traps
- **Learning loop** - log lessons and footguns after completion
- **Ceremony scaling** - hotfixes skip ceremony, system changes get full treatment

See `.goat-flow/skill-reference/skill-preamble.md` (installed) or `workflow/skills/reference/skill-preamble.md` (source template) for the canonical shared conventions.

## Where Skills Live

| Agent | Path |
|-------|------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/goat-{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/goat-{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `.agents/skills/goat-{name}/SKILL.md` |

Skills are created during step 03 of the GOAT Flow setup. The skill templates in `workflow/skills/` document the prompts used to create them.

> **Consolidation history (v0.8.0-v1.1.0):** Nine skills were consolidated into the current seven. See ADR-030 for the full rationale. goat-critique was extracted as a standalone critique skill in v1.1.0, then renamed from goat-sbao in v1.2.0 (ADR-033).
